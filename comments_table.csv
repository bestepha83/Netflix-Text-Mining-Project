25,i940wjk,t3_usia07,"Netflix diluted their own brand so badly. 

When they first started producing original content the pitch was ""Check *this* shit, we're making Hollywood-tier movies"" and pretty much you felt compelled to want to check them out on the basis that you trusted they were throwing considerable production effort behind them. 

Then they shifted to the ""greenlight everything, cancel after 2 seasons"" model which again, at first was kind of interesting because it did get a lot of creative and novel stuff out that would have otherwise never been produced. 

But eventually they've wound up in a place where the little red N is just as likely to mean 'high quality original production' as it is 'literally the dumbest shit you've ever seen in your life' and that's just a bad place to be, especially against the reality that over time users more or less out-watch the pace at which good new content can be made.

At the same time, they let licenses expire on a lot of non-Netflix content while competitors stepped up with compelling services. End result, Netflix is flooded with red N content that the user basically has no idea if it's worth their time. 

A simple 'fix' would be rebranding and making imprints instead of placing everything under the N banner, but it's probably too little and too late for that.",iuytrefdgh436yujhe2,1652902236.0,225

46,i644w9h,t3_ubh8ww,"It’s being done to death now but I was interested in how many people say they log on and look for something to watch but can find nothing. Same experience I have. I had assumed that with Netflix being well established and their algorithms that they’d have nailed what to suggest to users now, but it seems instead to have become less accurate as time has gone on. 

The stories about Netflix losing subscribers has turned a blip in to a disaster for Netflix because it had become one of those unconscious aspects to monthly budgeting. I paid for it every month but when I saw that many others had cancelled it I thought about it properly for the first time in ages and realised I am nowhere near getting value for the monthly fee. I kept it as a convenience because ‘sometimes’ there was a show I wanted to watch, the the truth is that had become rarer and rarer. So now I have also cancelled my subscription. I hope they commit to better longer running shows (I think not making a 3rd season of Mindhunter was ridiculously short sighted. They assumed they could produce hits like a factory, but must now realise they cannot and shouldn’t have thrown away that opportunity). 

Netflix will no doubt introduce adverts, which will provoke fury but no long term damage. The long term damage is that even when subscriber numbers went up and up they struggled to make a profit and only recently did so. That has been achieved by reducing spending on marketing and new shows. Now they are finding their subscribers are losing interest due to those cut backs so a slide towards reduced profits (or even losses) beckons. They are caught between a rock and a hard place. The business seems to be very highly valued but eventually investors will want to see how that will translate in to sustained profits and I don’t think Netflix have an answer (and nor do I).",TheEconomistFable,1650883765.0,128

We are continuously signed up, but only watch it every couple months (Witcher a few months ago, Ozark right now, probably Stranger things in a few months). My mom's house has our account on her TV because my kids visit often enough that they use it there, and I think there's a possibility it's at my wife's parents house as well.

Literally the only reason we don't cancel is because it's ingrained in our system already and we don't want to take it away from the possible use at the parents house. If they start charging extra for it, or stop us from doing it? It's just canceled, that's all. We'll put Disney+ or Hulu or Sling up when they visit again. It seriously feels like a gym membership for one you barely attend threatening more fees at this point.

(edit:  as one Redditor pointed out, I forgot to mention *Is It Cake?* as a show that was worth the sub)

(edit2:  a few clarifications for things that have come up a few times: 

 I didn't mean *literally* like a gym membership, but as in a fee you keep paying even though you're not really using it, so there is no need to explain how I can't physically sneak people into a gym.

I absolutely agree it would be smarter to just quit everything and only subscribe to one service a month, cancel it, swap, etc. But there's no way most of us are doing that on multiple devices each month.

90,i5u8s8r,t3_u9wsbx,"For those too lazy to read the article, they plan to charge $3 per person not located in your household. A household now refers specially to primary account profile and has nothing to do with relation to primary account holder. For example, if your kid goes to college, they will be counted as an ""extra member"", and you'll have to pay extra. To quote the article ""Each sub-account will have its own profile and personalized recommendations — but they also have their own Netflix login and password..."" They plan to overhaul the profile section and will associate the profile with certain IP's and device ID's so you can travel and use multiple devices with the same profile. A sub-account is basically one of the sub-profiles but, based on Netflix's tracking, is considered to be another household due to the location difference.
It's not set in stone yet, so hopefully they realize this will tank them harder than ads ever could. They probably won't make they change until 2023 anyways. Their own research has shown there are 100 million households of the 220 million subscribers that share passwords. I don't think 100 million people are going to be pleased with a $3+ price increase.

The main reason though is price its to expensive and it keeps going up, the worlds not in a good place at the moment not everyone can afford it anymore as such they stop paying for it.

Then there is content, a lot of old series have been taken off Netflix by there various owners and used in there own streaming services as such with less content there is less reason to keep netflix

But what about netflix origonal content? Well people are starting to get tired of getting invested in a series that ends after one or two seasons more so if there are cliff hangers at the end.  And for the other series you actually want to follow well you can quit then just come back for a month binge watch the new series then quit again no need to stay subcribed in the mean time.

People are more inclined to accept a price increase if there getting more for the new cost but making people pay for something they already for for free stings and can backfire.

Their next questionable move was the Mulan release which they charged $30-$40 to view, not own.

At some point this meant that Netflix stopped being about being a platform, the one subscription you needed to have most of the content, to existing significantly on the back of their originals.

I can't say I'm too enthusiastic about this change. Yes, there's competition of a sort, but it's not so much in the sense of, say, Spotify vs Apple Music, where you can get most content on either platform, but instead a series of walled gardens you have to pay for individually for the content, many of which are technically inferior to Netflix/not available on as many platforms etc. So it's about whether you want Disney content or Netflix content or HBO content?

(Invasive Advertising and Data Selling should be criminal)  


Edit: So, replies to this notion seem to be pretty divided, so maybe I should explain more of what i mean when I say Advertising should be illegal. 

I do not think it should be illegal for information about products or services to be available, primarily via a means where you can go search actively for products and services - the client/consumer should be the one actively going to look, not the company trying to get in front of as many eyeballs as possible.  


What I feel should be illegal are duplicitous, misleading, and emotionally manipulative advertising content, especially when put in front of non-consenting eyes. Already, when what I'm doing is interrupted by advertisements every five minutes, all it's doing is wasting my time and actively making me loathe the advertisers even more.

> Researchers have managed to pack a quantity of data equivalent to 28,000 Blu-Rays inside a single 12-cm optical disk.

> In an article published in the Science Advances journal, the researchers argue that, while laser-enabled optical data storage offers the best option to meet the growing data demands, the differactive nature of light has limited the size of the information bits that can be recorded, in turn limiting the storage capacity of the optical disks.

> &quot;While advances are needed to optimize the technology, the results open new avenues to address the global challenge of data storage. The technology is suited to the mass production of optical disks, so that the potential is enormous,&quot; the researchers claim.

733,i1zu8py,t3_tmc3va,"What am I cutting if I don't use streaming either?

I'm old-fashioned I guess as I still buy Blu-Ray's and DVDs and even CDs. Don't have to worry about those being moved to other new streaming services or delisted or removed from streaming because of licensing or having episodes removed or changed or that sort of stuff. I can always rip them and have them readily accessible too, using this forgotten tech called local storage. 

It's a bigger up-front cost, of course. I'd rather pay $200 for a Blu-Ray Box-Set than pay a streaming subscription for a single television show, and at least I know that What I got isn't going to change. Episodes of shows or movie scenes or whatever aren't going to disappear from my physical media or ripped storage file sets, or suddenly turn into Laserdiscs and require me to buy a laserdisc player (rough analogy to moving to other services).

And I can watch them forever basically. It's a perpetual license. I can rip the physical discs to Video files and use them pretty much however I want. (Except, of course, distribution!), and I don't have to keep paying for a service every month to maintain access to them.

Streaming has always sort of felt like an affluence I suppose.

I don't see why Netflix, who pays to host their content on the web should be subject to paying again. If I create a game that is 100GB big and it sells really well, am I going to have ISPs coming after me for reimbursement? Do you go after Amazon Web Services or the individual companies for the the data they use? Lots of traffic goes through CloudFlare, do they need to pay up for all the data even though they are just providing DDOS protection and the companies behind it are using all the data? Seems like Courts really don't handle technology issues at all.

If I was Netflix and the country in question had a healthy and competitive ISP market I would argue they should just allow ISPs to slow down Netflix traffic, but they have to list what speed they are slowing Netflix down by. If the consumers have a choice, they will choose to go with ISPs that doesn't make their movies buffer like crazy. Or ISPs can offer a more expensive non filtered package. Of course, all increasing costs on the consumers does, is convince them to pirate what they want to watch.

> According to Reuters, the ISP is suing Netflix to pay up for using so much bandwidth and the maintenance costs due to traffic surges stemming from the streaming giant.

> In the blog, Netflix says it&#039;s been a &quot;Platform for the spread of new Hallyu culture through shows like Kingdom, Vincenzo, and even the recently premiered Squid Game.&quot; It also touted that Squid Game is the first Korean series to make it to the No. 1 spot on Netflix US.As for where all this is coming from? Earlier in June, a South Korean court sided against Netflix in a case where the streaming company argued that SK Broadband had no grounds to demand bandwidth fees.

> Back in 2014, Netflix and Comcast were at odds over the ISP throttling Netflix.

Netflix's business model is; Let the viewers decide when to watch something instead of watching 'live'.

So you, the viewer, add shows to your 'list' so you can watch them when you decide. This lets you keep binging one particular show before moving on to something new. 

Netflix management doesn't understand this and continue to act under the same rules as live television. 

Netflix premieres a new series and within 2 weeks it's cancelled because of low viewership...

I've lost count of how many shows I've removed from my watch list because by the time I get around to watching them, I've learned it's already canceled. 

No point in getting invested in something that I won't get closure on. At this point I'm so burned out on it, I won't even bother with a show unless it has multiple seasons already.

816,e2k63iu,t3_8zkbjw,"Perhaps it's just what I watch, but this doesn't surprise me. Hulu in particular has been eating their lunch by capturing really popular third-party content, meaning that when their in-house content misses, they have little to fall back on. Here are a few shows that Netflix lost to Hulu:

* 30 Rock
* Don't Trust the B In Apartment 23
* The X Files
* Bob's Burgers
* Scrubs
* Firefly
* Buffy the Vampire Slayer
* Lost
* The Golden Girls
* Full House (shocking given that Netflix is making the fucking successor!)

They also managed to lose the bidding on Seinfeld and This Is Us (and many more, but these are the biggies), and lost exclusivity on Archer.

These may not be the kind of shows that *attract* people, but they retain people. They're the comfortable favorites people watch time and time again. You can't totally avoid this kind of content, or you just become another single-creator content outfit that fails so consistently (how many of you are subscribers to FX+? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller?).

And lastly-- Hulu has done a ton to get competitive on plans, with their no ad plan a dollar more than the Netflix standard plan. Plus, they've got deals for live TV, HBO, and Showtime as a la carte add-ons.

I hated Hulu for the longest time, and their interface is a fucking joke, but it's most of what we watch now, except for briefly binging Netflix originals. It's not hard to see how a couple bad months of new content could really hurt them when they've let their safety net lapse to their strongest competition.",troglodyte,1531856076.0,3
817,e2ldopt,t3_8zkbjw,"
A title that better reflects the article would be that Netflix' growth has slowed due to lacks in quantity and quality of content.  

But if we just try for accuracy instead of matching title to the article, a more accurate title would be ""Netflix growth finally slows"".  Or with a more neutral tone, ""Netflix growth slows"".  

Words matter.  Twisting the article to suit a more clickable title is the lowest form of clickbait.  The twisting here being the omission of scope and context.   The article doesn't mention that NFLX also recovered much of the share price within a day to bring it to $379.  

And it doesn't mention that this $379 is up from $217 six months ago, and from $183 a year ago.  A short dip after quarterly reports is by no means falling off a cliff except in the most myopic of views.   Subscriptions are still growing, just not as fast as expected (they only added 5m+ subscribers instead of the 6m that was projected). 

Journalists, bloggers, you lose credibility with your audience when you leave these things out because they don't support the claims of your article title.  At best, your content looks like click-bait.  At worst, it could look like a hit piece pushing some agenda.  

Now, all of that said..  I agree with the thrust of the article's content: the lack of quality content is probably the biggest factor in the recent results they reported (and spurred the price correction).  And it will be for a while yet.  I just can't agree with the hyperbolically pessimistic portrayal of current financial position. 
 

Netflix and their investors have legitimate reasons to be worried about content.  There are multiple TV networks backing Hulu, and Disney, which is several TV networks in its own right, is coming around the corner.  Even a couple of the single networks like CBS are bopping around with their dunce cap on and thinking they can make a go of streaming.  

The only thing these older competitors can fight with is content (and to a lesser degree, user experience, which doesn't matter without the content).  Well..  ***could*** have fought with, I should say.  Now net neutrality is gone, and the distribution channels that have been partners of the TV networks for decades get to join the competitive battle.  If the current trend of ISP behavior continues, they will eventually weigh in on the media battle by punishing users who don't use a preferred delivery channel (see: artificial scarcity, data caps, paid prioritization).  

Of course, they'll phrase it as 'rewarding loyalty' or as some perk of being their customer. But really they're just stealing a pair of your socks and then giving one sock back to you as a gift.  This can't work unless bandwidth is scarce, though.  Bandwidth is not scarce at that level, at all, if the infrastructure is properly maintained.   If you can charge more when bandwidth is scarce, though, you create incentive to allow infrastructure to decay. Why spend the money to keep up with customer usage when you can not only avoid that expense but also charge both the user and the partner service more instead?  Forget ever taking a step beyond maintenance into building something new.  

The decay of our infrastructure is only good for the major stockholders of the oligopolies that own the key pieces of it.

The truth is, Netflix maintained at its current state can probably weather the loss of net neutrality alone, if it can keep to status quo with content.  But it's not just the one problem.  Artificially created risks are rising along both critical tiers of distribution and content as their dependencies are used against them.  It's like a pincer attack from multiple sides of a deeply intertwined industry.  And content creation is key to overcoming it.  

The great hope for them is their rapid growth, bucket loads of cash, and ability to adapt more quickly to shifts in technology.  I think adaptability will be key, but we're seeing signs here that they are struggling with it.   They're probably finding that their technical capability which worked so well up to this point might not have equipped them to introduce the same sort of innovation to creative processes that build content like great television shows.  

But, yeah, although they've had a great year and are still growing, that growth has slowed.  There's so much more interesting stuff to say about this topic..  spinning the article (via selective information scope and omission) to match a less accurate but more click-grabby title is laziness or incompetence to such a degree that it borders deception.

Bill buys XYZ at $150, and it drops to $100.  Now, if Tom buys at $100, would Tom ever say, ""I will only sell at $150 because that's where Bill breaks even""?   No, because Bill's entry price has nothing to do with Tom or the stock.  Tom does not even know about Bill.  Likewise, your own past entry price has nothing to do with the stock's current or future performance.  You are Bill, and the rest of the world is Tom.

Let's now say you never bought at $150, and you first discover the stock at $100, would you come fresh and buy today and say, ""I will sell at $150"".  No, you are not even aware that it traded at $150, and that is now a totally random number from thin air, and has nothing to do with the stock trading at $100 today.   You are Tom.  In both cases, you are buying at $100, but with totally different targets, one because of a random personal action in the past, that is totally disconnected from the actual stock prospects today.

Refusing to take a loss?  (""Only a paper loss"")?  To be clear, I am not saying you must sell, but understand the money is already gone.  Your brokerage statement says your account balance using today's price, not your entry price.    Ignoring tax implications, you are effectively buying back the stock at today's price.    Every day.   Hold if you're still bullish, or maybe DCA more if you're really bullish.  As they say, if you liked it at $150, then you really like it at $100.But, if you do not like it anymore, you still still ""buying"" it at $100, simply by still holding it.  Every day.  Also, what if the stock goes to $125?  Do you sell now?  Or is the $150 past affecting your decision making?   What if you never bought it at $150?  Now $100 to $125 is treated differently than $150 to $100 to $125.  Yet, it's the same move from $100 to $125.You also miss out on other opportunities while waiting to hit a totally arbitrary personal target that only matters to your brain only.

1.)They didn't lock down established IP when they had a chance.  They rented, rather than bought.  Now, maybe not every IP holder would have sold in perpetuity, but enough probably would have ... especially if it wasn't exclusive, to make a big difference.  Bit by bit Netflix basically lost the entirety of their worthwhile movie library and most of their television library (AMC excluded).  

2.)They tried to pivot into their own in-house movie and TV production, and unlike a company like HBOMax or Disney, they don't have an established creative hierarchy that knows what the fuck they're doing.  They basically paid hundreds of millions of dollars for unending garbage.  What's even worse, they continuously canceled shows they had created before their runs had ended ... which creates a cycle of pissed off customers unwilling to invest their time in the next show for fear it will also be axed early. 

3.)They raised prices and cracked down on usability while the service got worse.  Bad combination.

4.)When they began to lose content, they didn't actually pivot into a space where their funding and bandwidth could have allowed them a new way to dominate: news and sports.  Their steadfast decision to remain a rental and production house when their rental wing essentially died (as companies pulled back their IP) has been disastrous.

5.)They decided to become political activists.  Whether you agree or disagree with the socio-political positions they have taken as a company, the reality is that when a corporation takes a stand they're going to make someone mad.  

6.)They didn't return shareholder value in the form of dividends or stock buybacks.  I took a hard look at Netflix back in February or March of this year, thinking I might be buying a dip, but I concluded the stock was still massively overvalued.

Subsections have not historically dropped off due to price increases.

There have been several quarters in the past that were a near zero rise too.  Q1 20222 just happened to to the first instance below zero.  Q4 2021 was also a higher than average increase, and the negative is likely just dumb luck in timing with more jumping on late Q4 rather than early Q1.

While to us smaller traders/investors it seems like the reaction is sever and instant there is actually a lot of evidence that it takes a few days/weeks for this new information to play out and settle at its true new value. There are funds that move fast and create alpha this way. So even thought NFLX just got creamed the ultimately agreed upon valuation might still be quite a bit lower.

Linked to point 2, they are not making money through merch
Decision to ban sharing accounts might make them lost even more subscribers
In an inflationary environment people might choose to tighten the belt and cancel some of their streaming services.

I think that what Netflix needs to do to save themselves is to start focusing more on producing high quality content instead of just pumping out mediocre quantity.

Netflix currently cares more about always having some new content even if the new content is junk, and I think that their approach is a mistake and will no longer work as well now that the competition with strong reputations for producing high-quality shows has arrived with their own streaming services. Building strong fan communities around a few high-quality shows that people get heavily invested in and then rewarding those fanbases by not pre-maturely canceling the shows is a much better approach that Netflix needs to adopt.",StarWolf478,1650754460.0,3

In regards to 3 - they would've lost more then 200,000 subscribers but also gained many new ones. So they lost 700,000 from Russia but these were offset but new subscribers. At the end of the day their total net loss was 200,000.",Sportspharmacist,1650431752.0,5

Forward guidance for subscribers was negative.

Revenue still grew almost 10% even with a .1% loss of subscribers, operating margin is 25.1% (good), and EPS smashed estimates. 

Let's also keep in mind that subscribers are still up 6.7% Y/Y - not great, but still up 14m subscribers over last years q1.

While I agree that a loss of subscribers is horrible, it was also after a HUGE amount of new subscriptions due to the pandemic. 

Netflix estimates that 100m non-subscribers are using Netflix accounts, and they seem to have a plan to attempt to monetize those users.

1096,i86k9dq,t3_un7nlf,"I think it’s fundamentally different because Tesla is not making money selling Fords, Toyotas, or VWs. But that’s what Netflix was doing. Content owners were letting Netflix use their content for a fee. And over time the larger content owners have placed large and mostly successful bets on making their content exclusive to their platforms (and removing it from Netflix). Over that time Netflix has ramped up their own content generation business and that will likely keep them solvent for a while, but the massive growth days are over.  They are a content company now, not a platform company. And in the long run places like Disney or paramount have been in the content business for much longer and know how to make/buy good enough content in a financially constrained environment. Netflix will have to show similar abilities to compete financially. 

Tesla has succeeded on its own products from the start. I don’t think they will continue to have a valuation higher than all other auto OEMs combined, but I don’t think they’ll need to shift what their business focuses on fundamentally the way Netflix is having to. Other auto OEMs will catch up on EVs, maybe even exceed Tesla in terms of volume. But if Tesla does it right they will continue to be the “Apple” of automobiles.",HerbertKornfeldRIP,1652275815.0,16

Ford has $232b in assets; and about $37b of that is net property, plant and equipment. 

GM has $251B in assets, and about $41b is net property, plant and equipment.

But, you’d imagine, since GM and F are predominantly ICE car manufacturers, that the vast majority of their equipment, plant and manufacturing assets need to be wholesale replaced, refurbished and/or converted into EV manufacturing.

So, they’re sitting on a lot of assets that are, for lack of a better term, antiquated, as we move forward in time.

I don't think you understand how Bond Prices work. They're inversely related to interest rates - so with the expectation interest rates are going to increase, their prices fall. Obviously. This means that Coupon Rates have to increase - or you can buy Bonds when you think Interest Rate Increases are priced in. Then, wait for the next round of Interest Rate Decreases and sell them for a profit. So, yeah... Bonds are fairly attractive right now....

>Netflix and Facebook are still growth companies, their earnings quality is only improving, and they have IMMENSE pricing power that they've only begun to tap into

Yes, Netflix, a company that lost 200,000 Subscribers - the first time it's lost subscribers in 10 Years - is obviously a growth company. Facebook faces incredibly political headwinds and it's growth is slowing. You can be optimistic about its push into the Metaverse - but their core business model is stalling. You'd have to look at their other operations. But, again, biggest factor is regulation for Facebook.

>So-called 'investors' firmly believe that staples are the place to be right now, because 'interest rates' and 'inflation'.

Uh... Yeah... Interest rates signal contractionary macroeconomic policy - literally reducing aggregate demand and curtailing investment spending. It is a signal that the macroeconomy is overheating and a general pullback is needed. This means Consumer Staples are considered a relative safe place to put money - because they are generally Recession Proof.

>Inflation is good for corporate profitsInflation requires higher interest rates

Inflation is temporarily good for corporate profits - but it also depends on what kind of inflation. Demand Pull inflation is good, Cost Push inflation is bad. The overwhelming majority of inflation is Cost Push which is terrible for margins. Corporate Profits are a lagging indicator and what you really need to look at going forward are Profit Margins. You should be expecting them to shrink as Input Costs continue to increase.

Higher interest rates ARE A LITERAL CATASTROPHE FOR BONDS

I already commented on this - they're terrible if you already owned Bonds which is why people are selling them. They're attractive once the market incorporates Interest Rate Expectations. Once you feel the Bond Market has priced in expected Interest Rate Hikes they would be a great buy since you'll get a high Coupon Rate and also can sell them in the future during the next Easing Cycle

The answer is to own quality assets, which are companies with strong cash flows, moats, network effects, etc.

Which.... would be Consumer Staples....

>People calling this tech bubble 2.0 are either too young to understand what the tech bubble was, or too stupid to understand what it was.

Growth Companies rely on Consumer Discretionary and Easy Liquidity to finance expansion and growth - both of which are drying up fast. I'm not going to go into every company you mentioned, but when inflation is high, there is contractionary monetary policy, and real wages are shrinking, there is no reason to expect Consumer Discretionary will do well. If your real wages are shrinking and you need to spend more money on Consumer Staples (Groceries, Toiletries, Gasoline) you have less money to spend on things you'd normally get from Amazon. You're more likely to cancel your Netflix Account and spend that extra $15 on gas or something else.

TL;DR - Not going to respond to every point, but you're missing the mark completely.

How do they do this? There is simply too much cash in the economy (thanks to the Fed’s eight trillion in printing and backing of the junk bond market since 2012) Netflix Ponzi’s their bond payments have for a decade. So they issue bonds for capex, don’t pay off the principal on the bonds, and issue more bonds years later to cover the cost of the previous bond payments. Same thing the fed and the government do with t-bills. Basically how the government is allowed to function with $28 trillion in debt and constant deficit spending. 

Netflix has six outstanding bond issuances with maturities between 2022 and 2028. Payments and debt are listed in their 10-K.

1413,hxh75fr,t3_svhe3l,"For anyone looking at a stock and thinking that it's a ""good deal"" because it's 50, 60, 70 percent off highs, I'd encourage you to look at what happened to some stocks after the Dotcom bubble. I'll use Intel (INTC) as an example.

INTC rocketed in the dotcom boom with its share price increasing from \~$20 to a height of $75. Once the dotcom bubble burst, it's share price dropped to \~$40, almost 50% off highs. From there, it proceeded to drop to $30, staying in that range for a few months, before dropping to $20, almost 75% off highs.

If you had bought the stock at this point, you would have seen it grow again to $35 a share in a few months (not bad) before it plunged to new lows of $13-14 a share. Buying at that point, you would have ridden the stock back up to $35, before it dropped yet again. For the next few years INTC would go up and down, but in a downward trend, until it finally bottomed at \~$12 a share in the 2009 financial crisis, almost \*a full decade\* after the dotcom bubble burst.

Today, INTC trades at $45 a share, not far off from its price after the initial dotcom burst. Think about the opportunity cost of holding a stock like INTC through the decades.

A few things to take away:

Is INTC a cherrypicked example? Absolutely. Other stocks rebounded extraordinarily well from the dotcom crash, like AMZN, GOOG. How confident are you that the stocks you're considering are the next AMZN and GOOG and not the next INTC? What features of the stock or the company led to your conclusion? Have you done the research you need to do to make an intelligent hypothesis?

Was INTC untradable? Absolutely not. If you had bought the stock at $13 a share, you could have sold at $35 a little more than a year later. That's a stellar return. But do you have a system that will let you capture these types of moves and avoid riding the roller coaster back down? Do you have a price target grounded in reality? And a plan for what to do if the stock never reaches your price target? Do you have rules for when you sell a stock?",Ldubble,1645208860.0,65

But a lot of rising dot com stars ended up epically collapsing or being bought out. Inevitably the same thing happens with new industries.

If you think you're dumb for not buying it, Warren Buffett only pulled the trigger on Apple in 2016. Imagine if Buffett followed the same logic here and put all his money into Apple and the other companies 13 years ago. He'd be multi-trillionaire (theoretical based).

Unless you had balls of steel and held all this way (these usually tend to be people who buy and literally never check their portfolio), many eventually sold and bought it again at a higher basis, etc.,",Chromewave9,1646327292.0,299

Like, I think Apple is overvalued right now at a PE of 26, but even I don't think Apple is going to crash 80% from ATH.  At ATH, its PE was 32.  Historical PE floor is 10.  So even with that extreme multiple compression, current EPS puts the floor at 61.5, which would be a 66% drop based on nothing but sentiment.

To get to -80% (36.49), you have to get a 66% multiple drop and a 40% earnings drop.  That would take an utter catastrophe that quite frankly...look...even as a bear myself, you just can't predict that kind of catastrophe, so there's no point in even considering it or trying to plan for it, because you'll be paralyzed by fear *always*, because there's *always* the possibility that everything will blow up in your face.

A reasonable expectation would be another 10-25% down from here in the broad market, varying by the type of company or industry.  You can't point to anything fundamental or statistical to justify a fear of anything greater than that.  To be sure--it could still happen, absolutely.  But you cannot be *reasonably* fearful of that, in my opinion.

As an aside: Netflix is a different story.  Anyone with half a lick of sense could reasonably say that its continued expansion was implausible, due to a huge number of competitors in the media space, and that a PE of 60 was way too much. That was a perfectly reasonable position to take, and look, it panned out.  But Netflix hasn't crashed due to the market going tits-up--it's crashed because a lot of folks came to their senses and started valuing it as what it is: a media company.

1591,hwoql7e,t3_sqvm4k,"Not sure if I would go so far as saying ""once in a decade"", but I do think semis are going to be the strongest performing sector for the next few years (their cyclical upcycle will never have been stronger than this particular cycle).  

It's kinda funny to see people talking about valuations here while seemingly ignoring the fact that companies like TSM, QCOM, AMAT, AMD, and NVDA have literally grown their revenues by over 30% in the last year while improving margins.  AMD alone grew 68% (not including XLNX).  

QCOM (who grew revenue by 30%) sees automotive as moving from a 1B market to a 10B market by the end of the decade.  They are also trading at a forward PE less than 15 with strong FCF.  

TSMC's CEO in the last earnings call called out that what's different today is amount of silicon content per 'device'.  Even if we sell just as many PCs/phones next year as the last... there are more chips and more expensive chips in each device.  We are also starting up a 5G CapEx cycle.

The bigger deal is going to be how the world handles mass adoption of EVs and chargers.  The typical EV has 4x the amount of silicon content per car than the typical ICE car and as more enter the ecosystem there will be increased computing needs to improve the intelligence of the electrical grid.

Because she has so many devastating losses in her small caps that she is the largest owner in, she has to sell the only liquid large stock she owns with positive performance to keep the other turds she has afloat. 

""By selling liquid holdings to support illiquid holdings ARK is becoming more illiquid. That is what U.K.-based fund Woodford Capital did before suspending redemptions and closing.  
The hedge funds that may attempt to blow up ARK have more patient and sophisticated capital than ARK’s retail base. The strategy of getting more illiquid for temporary support won’t work.""

I am not nearly as worried about the numbers for Q1 as I would be for the remainder of the year for both companies.   So with Microsoft they will share that and Google unlikely.

Google and Microsoft are nothing like Netflix.  So I do NOT see a repeat.   Google has an actual moat where Netflix really never did.   Same with Microsoft.   Google has multiple moats that are very deep.

Netflix is in a tough position with so much competition.   Which also then increases the cost of acquiring content.

The host didn't respond immediately - but before the end of the interview the host said 'He took issue' with that comment.

Deutsche Bank Sees 5%-6% Fed Target Rate and Deep U.S. Recession
A significant recession by next year seems likely, it says
U.S. unemployment may rise several points, economists project

The Federal Reserve is likely to need to engage in the most aggressive monetary tightening since the 1980s to tamp down an inflation rate at a four-decade high, which will lead to a deep U.S. recession next year, Deutsche Bank AG economists warned.
“We assume conservatively that a Fed funds rate moving well into the 5% to 6% range will be sufficient to do the job this time,” the authors including David Folkerts-Landau, group chief economist and head of research, wrote in a report Tuesday. “This is partly because the monetary-tightening process will be bolstered by Fed balance-sheet reduction, which our U.S. economics team estimates will be equivalent to a couple additional 25 basis-point rate hikes.”
This monetary tightening and the financial upheaval that accompanies it “will push the economy into a significant recession by late next year,” Folkerts-Landau said, adding Deutsche sees the unemployment ultimately rising “several percentage points.”
The Deutsche economists -- by their own admission -- are much more pessimistic than most other major forecasters. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimated chances of a contraction at about 35% over the next two years. Bloomberg Economics’ recession-probability model has estimated a 44% chance of recession happening before January 2024.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues have said their goal is to achieve a soft landing -- cooling the U.S. economy to bring inflation back down toward their 2% goal while preserving a robust labor market. The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to raise rates by half a percentage point at its May 3-4 meeting and announce it’ll start shrinking its $9 trillion balance sheet.
In the Deutsche economists’ view, the FOMC’s plans to raise rates to a neutral level -- one that neither stimulates nor contracts growth -- of around 2.5% won’t go nearly far enough to ease inflation. That’s because of a rising-price psychology taking root among American households, and an extremely tight labor market, where unemployment has fallen to 3.6%. 
Deutsche estimated a neutral rate that’s much higher than the Fed’s view, around 5%, and projected the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield will rise to 4.5% to 5%.",State_Dear,1651132121.0,1

That means the one thing Netflix can (and MUST!) do is get their drunken studio under control.  They need to flip from being the worst run studio in the business to the best.  Yes, that's a tall order, but it's mandatory if they expect to control their own destiny. 

Otherwise they can bleed for awhile and keep hahazardly approving and cancelling content, while radically overpaying.  But they will eventually run out of magic dust.  

One way is to use an onlyfans model where they provide an amazing platform for content providers, and pay the most successful content makers handsomely.

I mean they are consciously spending 5 Billions (!) in stock buyback at a historical moment where they have never had as many competitors and as much content being pumped into competitive platforms. Disney or Apple alone could push them out of business. Netflix original content is practically reduced to copy - paste high school drama series. They lost third party content.

I already do this and it is so much cheaper to just buy the stuff that I'm interested in one time rather than continually paying multiple streaming services. If I went the streaming route, I would have to subscribe to at least 5 different streaming services to get just about half of my favorites and that still wouldn't even give me access to the other half of my favorites.

I imagine it is a similar situation for most people so will it ever get to the point where most people have had enough of their favorite content being spread across too many different services and realize that it would be cheaper to just buy the content that really interests them and not have to worry about what service is their favorite content on this month anymore?",StarWolf478,1617916850.0,5

If you look at market wide p/e this is not the lowest it has been. Shiller p/e for the S&P500 right before the recent correction was only higher ca. 2008 and even now after a ca. 10% drop is pretty high.

But that not even the point, people say we are in a bubble because these stocks grew 400% since 2008 in the last crash, aka they are 5 times bigger. Not only stocks, but every single asset balloned, like crytpto and the housing market. Did the real economy get 5x bigger? Are we 5x more productive?

The growth is only sustained by the US fed providing infinite credit at 0% interest (or as some like to call it, printing a lot of money). Which everybody (those with money of course) uses to get more credit and buy the exact same assets, which increase in price, allowing them to get more credit, rinse and repeat. And more than that, all that new money created led to 0 inflation in all these years (until today, and one can argue that this is a supply-side inflation). So all that money never increased demand, just went to assets. Another thing is that I would also argue that the profit margins most of these big companies put up, is only possible due to this 0% interest bonanza, if interests goes up i bet profits will also crash.

All this to say, that yeah this one big bubble and the only contrarian argument is that is not a bubble because it hasnt burst yet (which is what makes it a bubble). A bubble does not burst by itself, as long as there is liquidity coming in. You can try to argue that you can get away with this forever, which is absolutely crazy to me.

1705,htq0jn6,t3_s9wwzr,"I might be blunt, but this portfolio is made entirely from meme stocks. These are usually unprofitable companies, which reached sky-high valuations on pure speculation in 2020/21. Most likely their stock prices will correct to some reasonable levels sometimes in the future either by the companies increasing their revenue or the stock price falling. Some of them already corrected. First you should read Burton J. Malakiel's A random walk through Wall street and Peter (not David) Lynch's One up Wall street! Both devote entire chapters to these irrational bubbles and how stocks behave under these circumstances.  The catch is that during the investing mania phase these stocks perform incredibly well, as investors build air castles and buy them like crazy. However when the mania dies off, their shares tumble without any kind on support, since they were not that good companies to begin with. They bring the most profit, when you buy them relatively cheap and then sell them when the price starts to deteriorate.

Your stocks reflect this exact problem. Most of these companies generate losses. Nio, Eyes, Joby, Sofi, Aht, Btx, Cpe, Spce, Dkng, Fubo, Amc, Clov, are all generating losses. These stock's valuations are simply based on hopes that in the foreseeable future they will grow/improve to the point that they will make some profits.

In the old days, investors like Malakiel and Lynch advised, that a PE of over 15 is an extremely risky bet on any stock. This rule most likely faded, you can only buy tobacco companies that cheap nowadays. Still, the PE of Tesla being \~300, MP being 59, these are extremely high even in today's markets. The average PE sits around 40 now. The only reasonably priced paper in this portfolio is Rlx, with a PE of 25. Arkg and Arkk invest their money into the same category of stocks, they will follow the performance of your other stocks closely.

You have several paths you can take from here, the choice most likely depending on your predictions on market behavior. None of us can tell you what will happen in the future, you have to rely on your own assessment of the situation.

1. If you think that this is a transitory phenomenon and these stocks will increase to their previous levels, hold them and simply wait until your portfolio increases in value.
2. If you think that this is the market crash that people have been expecting for a time, then sell everything and put the money into treasury bonds.
3. If you think this is just a routing of the more speculative excess, you can sell everything and put your money into sp500 index funds hoping that the contagion will not reach the larger companies.
4. If you think this contagion only affects tech stocks,  you can sell everything and put the money into value index funds. That way you can avoid the tech collapse.

1715,gmkeyqm,t3_lf15za,"To answer your questions:

**Would it be a good idea to invest before this happens(if it does)?**

Yes, mergers or buy-outs will (nearly) always make the stock of the weaker company increase in value.

**Or would AMC stock forfeit?**

No, if a company is bought and gets consumed by the buyer i.e. AMC ceases to exist and becomes 'Netflix Cinema', they will have an agreement in place to value each share at a certain amount. So, if AMC is trading at say $7 a share, Netflix might offer $8 a share. As such the shareholder has each unit of stock converted to $8 cash and deposited into their account.

**Side note:**

Should probably add that in some cases even though the company is bought it still continues under its own name and management rather than being engulfed. In that case your shares go up in value and you get to keep them rather then being converted into cash.",AuthorAdamOConnell,1612777607.0,16

Personally I think Disney has a ton of upside, but whether or not they actually execute it well is still unknown.  For example, will their new Star Wars content be better than the sequal trilogy?  If so that could add back a lot of value.

I also think Disney has a lot of markets they can enter and so there is still a lot of room for subscriber growth.  I am still interested to see the sub retention/churn because of their relative lack of content but also since Disney+ acts as a kind of babysitter for families with kids so theywouldn't unsub anyway.

NFLX is profitable, but net income doesn’t really matter in film, cash flow does. Despite clearing $5 billion in NI, the company’s operations only generated $392 million of cash flow. Compare that to its outstanding debt balance of $14.5 billion and you see why a company would hesitate to bring such a company into their own books. 

The film & TV industry isn’t profitable for most participants, largely because it’s such a hit-or-miss business. I used to work in the finance side of this industry — it’s mostly a billionaires playground. Streaming platforms insulate themselves a little bit through subscription revenue, but there are so many options now that they’re still pressured to **continually** pump out high quality movies and shows — hence why NFLX used $17.7 billion of cash on content last year, which they will likely continue doing for the foreseeable future or else risk losing unsatisfied subscribers.

The prospect of doubling your money may sound daunting. Given enough years, you have an *outstandingly* good chance to do just that. The trick is to adjust your idea of how long that takes.

The stock market slowly rises over the long term - something like 8% per year if you reinvest your dividends. So here's a little math exercise. Take 1.08 and multiply it by 1.08. That represents two years of gains. Keep multiplying by 1.08 and you see that it doubles in 9 years. In 18 years it doubles twice. 27 years, three times, 36 years four times etc.

Here's the thing though : three doubles is not 2+2+2; it's 2x2x2. So three doubles multiplies your money by 8. Four doubles multiplies your money by 16. If you are young enough that you can invest for 45 years, you will multiply your money by 32 times!

You don't have to hit home runs to make a lot of money in the stock market. You can make an absolute killing in the market just hitting singles if you give it enough time.

So what does it mean to ""hit singles""? Don't pressure yourself to keep up with the latest hot company. Have a broad basket of stocks where a few of them are cool and sexy, but most are boring but profitable. Examples could be retailers, banks and insurers, manufacturers, home builders, truck/train, utilities, real estate (REITs), and many more.

If you like the idea of investing but you want to let someone else pick the stocks, get an S&P index etf like SPY.

You can do this! Don't give up!

I have a hard time believing that the businesses best set up to benefit from the prior paradigm will also be optimal for the next phase. In real terms, apple is highly leveraged to China. Both in terms of supply chain and product sales. Google is leveraging to economic growth and marketing spend (a recession means decreasing GDP, means layoffs, marketing spend typically drops first for companies). Amazon is facing unions, and slower economic growth. Start-ups are laying people off and unable to raise capital (VCs are sending out notes across the board saying no capital from us for the next 12 months minimum), and most of their best cloud customers are start-ups that got big. FB seems totally screwed. Netflix is being beaten by companies with an existing cash cow, that allows them to subsidize their content production. 

Long story short, the world is changing. It is de-globalizing and de-leveraging. PE multiple will come down as interest rates rise. This hurts hurt the tech sector more than anything else.

I’ve bought [22,000](https://imgur.com/a/RVNolb0) shares of Meta in the past 8 weeks. They are criminally undervalued and I’m happy to take scared money. It’s FCF machine, growing at double digits, sitting on a $60B war chest. 

You need to do your own due diligence, and when one makes a seven figure trade, the due diligence is pages long. But I'll add just a few notes beyond Big Blue’s ad biz:

It’s got one of the cleanest, if not the strongest, balance sheets in all of America. I’m on mobile so I’d have to go back later and check my notes, but I had the intrinsic value of $FB roughly at >$410. 

If a “bad” quarter, regularly scheduled poor guidance from a sandbagger of a CFO, a war between two countries that have the GDP of Italy and the threat of a measly 25 bps rate rise want to scare the market into selling me the stock at a 50% discount, I will *literally* buy millions of it. Gladly.

They haven't even monetized WhatsApp, which has 2B+ reach in the world. I'm not sure Americans understand how reliant places like India and Brazil are on WhatsApp. You literally order food, get a cab and speak with your doctor via WhatsApp. It's essentially a public utility for most of the world. And it continues to grow. Yet the money faucet hasn't been turned on. There is likely tens of billions yet to be tapped into here.

Threats of TikTok were overstated (intentionally), Reels isn't yet monetized (Instagram continues to grow), growth of Blue (Facebook's core product) were in line (it's gotta saturate at some point). Yes, iOS 14 privacy changes hurt, but there are ways of aggregating data on the backend using personal identifiers as a way of building your ad profile. This will take time, but they will continue to grow, despite what legendary sandbagger CFO Wehner says. And keep in mind, Meta doesn't sell your data, they sell targeting. People love to misquote this. And the talent they have at the company, my god, is the best in the Valley.

Lastly, I don't care if you love him or hate him, Zuck will go down as one of the greatest capital allocators of all time: buying Instagram for $1B and which is now worth well over $100B, buying WhatsApp for a paltry $19B which essentially owns messaging worldwide and is the world's communication utility (except for the US, which they are trying to break into (did you see the ads during the AFC Championship game)) and now the Metaverse. Google and Microsoft are bleeding top talent to Meta to build the Metaverse which will be CapEx heavy for years. Meta is lightyears ahead in this space. And don't get it twisted - while you may not use the Metaverse, Gen Z will (in ways, they already are) and they will spend money in it. It is the future whether you like it or not.

(Also, good fucking luck, Lina Khan)

Because of the macro shift. If the Fed follows through then I personally think the top is in for the market for the next bit, and it's going to be nothing but sideways and downward with maybe some pops that get sold off. Rinse repeat as they either walk the market down or it dips into a recession.

And the Fed JUST started turning hawkish. It's like people have no attention span and think a leg down means we're done.

Sure, itll go up and down. That's what it does. But the TOP DOWN trend is down until they change their tune.

A lot of people are worried about the trade off between theaters and streaming -- I feel like it's actually the tv networks are at the expense of streaming SVOD and AVOD platforms. The reason being is mostly product -- when these streaming services announce their product, they might mention a few films but *it is always the tv series* that are the core to the platform. They are the Crown Jewels that keep people subscribed. Some examples:

&#x200B;

Disney: Wandavision, Mandalorian

Paramount+: Star Trek franchise, Frazier, Rugrats, Avatar: The Last Airbender franchise

Netflix: Stranger Things, Bridgerton, Queen's Gambit, The Crown

HBO Max: Sex and the City, The Flight Attendant

Peacock: The Office, Law & Order SVU Franchise

Hulu: Handmaiden's Tale, Dollface, Solar Opposites

Since they said that, they absolutely have become HBO (look at all their originals), before HBO could become them.  Instead of HBO though, you have CBS and Disney.

This is all to say, the battle comes down to original content.  Can they create enough original content people demand better than other people can.  The scary part here is that the original content is a hard fight to win.  You need to build up tent pole series (Think GoT for HBO, Orange and House of Cards for Netflix, Star Trek for CBS, and all disney for Disney).  In this world, CBS and Disney have an advantage in IP.  HBO has historical ability to do it.  

TLDR.  Netflix next has to compete one things which it doesn't have advantage (content) from the position of 1st.  My personal judgement says its scary and not worth the multiples today.

The public doesn't like it when you yank content from one place they normally get it from and lock it in one place that you have to get it from. History shows most people are **not** willing to follow streamers/etc. to the new location.

Shroud for example lost 85% of his viewers when took a bunch of money from Microsoft to stream exclusively on their (now defunct) streaming service. The fact that the service is now defunct says it all in regards to how well Microsoft spent those tens of millions of dollars locking in exclusivity deals. Viewers didn't even have to pay to watch Shroud, it was literally just typing in a different URL in their web browser.

Whether they overtake in subscribers and how soon all depends on when growth slows to the pace of Netflix. So far it looks like the first two quarters will have gains of 25m+.With a good deal of key markets left to open in (Western Europe, Latin America, Asia), I genuinely think we may see both q3 and q4 have 20m+ net gains. That would be a huge plus for overtaking Netflix. 

The key questions are 

At what point does it stop having 20m+ gains

At what point does it stop having 15m+ gains

At what point does it stop having 10m+ gains

If we can get through 2021 without breaking through all of these then I would consider it forgone.

Concentration in select stocks can provide periods of outperformance vs the index(es). It’s more difficult to sustain outperformance over time whenever you start actively managing / trading and introduce emotion into potential decision making re: positions.

And when you mention “why VTI if I can diversify myself”… if you bought the 7 names above (all generally correlated to growth stocks), this would not be considered diversification.

2219,i1d0yq9,t3_tibcg8,"You *could.* You could also significantly underperform it.  Concentration widens the range of potential outcomes. You have very little diversification with those names though.  They're all super tech heavy, all priced for growth, mostly mega cap.  They're going to move together.

Diversification would look more like Deere, Apple, Google, Waste Management, Delta Airlines, Chevron, Home Depot, Allstate, JP Morgan, Union Pacific, etc. (Ideally with some small/mid cap exposure as well, but those names aren't as recognizable for this example). If you're absolutely convinced that your names will outperform, you can choose to be concentrated.  There's nothing *inherently* wrong with it, but it is a much riskier strategy.

My gut tells me that the next decade will not be as kind to MSFT, TSLA, Apple, NFLX, Shopify, Amazon, Alphabet, etc.  It's pretty atypical that the best runners from the past decade *all* have a stellar next decade.  My guess is some of the rosiness in their projections doesn't work out, increase interest rates make everything drop, and they just kind of have an okay decade.

Any decline in iPhone sales or entertainment subscriptions can happen any quarter and would send their valuation tumbling down.

I’m not saying you aren’t right, I think nflx is on the expensive side myself, but there is way more nuance to a name like nflx than just the fact it has a high pe.  Discard pe and look at something like scale for a name like this.  Say they can get into 500m households, have pricing power bc they delight customers, so every 2 years they can raise subscription by $1/month.  Play with numbers like that instead of just looking at head line pe.  ",djcoshareholder,1546653000.0,20

Remember cable had no ads at first. That's going to alienate customers so NFLX will need to balance debt, OC, price hikes, and eventually ads. They will make more over all by pricing some out and doubling $$ from the 80% that keep the service.

The real question is can they keep making hits that will sell at a higher premium per month and or with ads. I figure I got my initial investment out and reinvested. It's worth the gamble for me. ",tangalaporn,1546666378.0,3

Today, its not a big deal for a company with a server to put video content on the internet so if you break it down the only edge Netflix has is a likely ability to produce high quality original content. I like a chunk of their content, but I don't think their stock price correctly reflects a company that's success hinges on putting out new seasons of Bojack Horseman or Stranger Things every year. No other stock that's long term success hinges strongly on continuously producing well-liked content is priced similarly..",completefarside,1546658162.0,7

2321,hrqfczb,t3_ryndkk,"Very subjective question... I would rank based on safety 1st then valuation. For me, top would be Amazon. By far the safest since its not all tech and because its ratios are misleading. They are far more profitable than they seem. In terms of safety, they are the only one of the club that is diversified. After that it would be MSFT due to enterprise foothold. Those are the two safest long term. 

With the rest I would look at valuation but honestly 3-5 are interchangeable.

Not crazy about NVDA or NFLX for the ""N"" addition. Have no confidence in NVDA very long term (say 10 years out). Short term (sub 3 years) yes but then it gets hazy for me. I think a lot of things have to go right for them and its too unpredictable. NFLX is about to face an onslaught of competition so it will likely slow.

If I had to rank, I would do:

1. Amazon
2. Microsoft
3. Facebook (just because its beat down right now)
4. Google
5. Apple (because I think growth will slow)
