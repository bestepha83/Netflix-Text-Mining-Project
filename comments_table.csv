In the beginning cable TV had no commercials, you paid for cable so you didn't have commercials like over the air broadcasts. 

Then they slowly started adding commercials claiming it would lower prices (spoiler: it didn't). 

Then it was inundated with commercials.  The commercials started getting longer as well. 

In comes streaming.  You pay to have no commercials.

We are continuously signed up, but only watch it every couple months (Witcher a few months ago, Ozark right now, probably Stranger things in a few months). My mom's house has our account on her TV because my kids visit often enough that they use it there, and I think there's a possibility it's at my wife's parents house as well.

Literally the only reason we don't cancel is because it's ingrained in our system already and we don't want to take it away from the possible use at the parents house. If they start charging extra for it, or stop us from doing it? It's just canceled, that's all. We'll put Disney+ or Hulu or Sling up when they visit again. It seriously feels like a gym membership for one you barely attend threatening more fees at this point.

(edit:  as one Redditor pointed out, I forgot to mention *Is It Cake?* as a show that was worth the sub)

(edit2:  a few clarifications for things that have come up a few times: 

 I didn't mean *literally* like a gym membership, but as in a fee you keep paying even though you're not really using it, so there is no need to explain how I can't physically sneak people into a gym.

I absolutely agree it would be smarter to just quit everything and only subscribe to one service a month, cancel it, swap, etc. But there's no way most of us are doing that on multiple devices each month.

> Netflix won&#039;t carry the 20 Russian free-to-air propaganda channels that they could be required to host under Russian law.

> In December 2021, Netflix was added by the Russian regulator, Roskomnadzor, to its register for audiovisual services because the SVOD reached over 100,000 subscribers.

> Netflix is theoretically required as part of a law - known locally as the Vitrina TV law - to distribute 20 &quot;Must-carry&quot; free-to-air Russian news, sports and entertainment TV channels.

> According to Reuters, the ISP is suing Netflix to pay up for using so much bandwidth and the maintenance costs due to traffic surges stemming from the streaming giant.

> In the blog, Netflix says it&#039;s been a &quot;Platform for the spread of new Hallyu culture through shows like Kingdom, Vincenzo, and even the recently premiered Squid Game.&quot; It also touted that Squid Game is the first Korean series to make it to the No. 1 spot on Netflix US.As for where all this is coming from? Earlier in June, a South Korean court sided against Netflix in a case where the streaming company argued that SK Broadband had no grounds to demand bandwidth fees.

> Back in 2014, Netflix and Comcast were at odds over the ISP throttling Netflix.

If Netflix is requested dedicated line from the ISP, and is increasing the bandwidth requirements on it drastically, then they should be paying for it. 

If the ISP setup a dedicated line to ease congestion in their own network that's on them, and their end users. 

I have no idea how Netflix's CDN is setup, but I'd have to imagine they'd have a CDN server in S. Korea with the Korean language content and the most popular shows mirrored to it. Having multiple ISP's providing service to a CDN, data center, or even large company is the first rule of networking.

Input delay combined with streaming video delay is a significant detriment to the gaming experience for most games, and it's a very hard problem to solve.

Lunas cellular input approach was the most innovative and imo best solution to date, but even steam links or moonlight local game streaming has enough delay to ruin the experience for most games.  Additionally, these services all take the same approach of having only a couple major data centers, which fucks over most people outside of say, Cali and the Virginia areas (this is guarantied to make this type of service fail every time).

Then there's the whole 720 vs 1080 vs 4k thing, all of which impact delay due to video streaming bandwidth limitations (primarily because internet infrastructure in the US is TERRIBLE compared to most of the world).

Sources familiar with the matter told the FT that the UK Competition and Markets Authority is expected to reverse Meta's acquisition of Giphy in the coming days.

The FT did not specify when the announcement would be made, but the CMA has a deadline of December 1 to issue its decision. 

Facebook announced in May 2020 it was acquiring Giphy for $400 million. Antitrust regulators in the UK and Australia announced a month later that they were scrutinizing the deal.

The CMA's initial enforcement order stopped Facebook from integrating with Giphy while it conducted the probe.

The CMA issued a provisional finding in August 2021 saying the merger would harm competition, and that the only effective remedy would be for Meta to sell Giphy. 

In that finding, the CMA said control over Giphy could give Facebook an unfair advantage over rival social media platforms such as Snapchat and TikTok which also use Giphy. It also argued that the merger would remove Giphy as a potential competitor to Meta in the display

Hulu in particular has been eating their lunch by capturing really popular third-party content, meaning that when their in-house content misses, they have little to fall back on. Here are a few shows that Netflix lost to Hulu:

* 30 Rock
* Don't Trust the B In Apartment 23
* The X Files
* Bob's Burgers
* Scrubs
* Firefly
* Buffy the Vampire Slayer
* Lost
* The Golden Girls
* Full House (shocking given that Netflix is making the fucking successor!)

They also managed to lose the bidding on Seinfeld and This Is Us (and many more, but these are the biggies), and lost exclusivity on Archer.

These may not be the kind of shows that *attract* people, but they retain people. They're the comfortable favorites people watch time and time again. You can't totally avoid this kind of content, or you just become another single-creator content outfit that fails so consistently (how many of you are subscribers to FX+? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller?).

And lastly-- Hulu has done a ton to get competitive on plans, with their no ad plan a dollar more than the Netflix standard plan. Plus, they've got deals for live TV, HBO, and Showtime as a la carte add-ons.

I hated Hulu for the longest time, and their interface is a fucking joke, but it's most of what we watch now, except for briefly binging Netflix originals. It's not hard to see how a couple bad months of new content could really hurt them when they've let their safety net lapse to their strongest competition.",troglodyte,1531856076.0,3
446,e2ldopt,t3_8zkbjw,"
A title that better reflects the article would be that Netflix' growth has slowed due to lacks in quantity and quality of content.  

But if we just try for accuracy instead of matching title to the article, a more accurate title would be ""Netflix growth finally slows"".  Or with a more neutral tone, ""Netflix growth slows"".  

Words matter.  Twisting the article to suit a more clickable title is the lowest form of clickbait.  The twisting here being the omission of scope and context.   The article doesn't mention that NFLX also recovered much of the share price within a day to bring it to $379.  

And it doesn't mention that this $379 is up from $217 six months ago, and from $183 a year ago.  A short dip after quarterly reports is by no means falling off a cliff except in the most myopic of views.   Subscriptions are still growing, just not as fast as expected (they only added 5m+ subscribers instead of the 6m that was projected). 

Journalists, bloggers, you lose credibility with your audience when you leave these things out because they don't support the claims of your article title.  At best, your content looks like click-bait.  At worst, it could look like a hit piece pushing some agenda.  

Now, all of that said..  I agree with the thrust of the article's content: the lack of quality content is probably the biggest factor in the recent results they reported (and spurred the price correction).  And it will be for a while yet.  I just can't agree with the hyperbolically pessimistic portrayal of current financial position. 
 

Netflix and their investors have legitimate reasons to be worried about content.  There are multiple TV networks backing Hulu, and Disney, which is several TV networks in its own right, is coming around the corner.  Even a couple of the single networks like CBS are bopping around with their dunce cap on and thinking they can make a go of streaming.  

The only thing these older competitors can fight with is content (and to a lesser degree, user experience, which doesn't matter without the content).  Well..  ***could*** have fought with, I should say.  Now net neutrality is gone, and the distribution channels that have been partners of the TV networks for decades get to join the competitive battle.  If the current trend of ISP behavior continues, they will eventually weigh in on the media battle by punishing users who don't use a preferred delivery channel (see: artificial scarcity, data caps, paid prioritization).  

Of course, they'll phrase it as 'rewarding loyalty' or as some perk of being their customer. But really they're just stealing a pair of your socks and then giving one sock back to you as a gift.  This can't work unless bandwidth is scarce, though.  Bandwidth is not scarce at that level, at all, if the infrastructure is properly maintained.   If you can charge more when bandwidth is scarce, though, you create incentive to allow infrastructure to decay. Why spend the money to keep up with customer usage when you can not only avoid that expense but also charge both the user and the partner service more instead?  Forget ever taking a step beyond maintenance into building something new.  

The decay of our infrastructure is only good for the major stockholders of the oligopolies that own the key pieces of it.

The truth is, Netflix maintained at its current state can probably weather the loss of net neutrality alone, if it can keep to status quo with content.  But it's not just the one problem.  Artificially created risks are rising along both critical tiers of distribution and content as their dependencies are used against them.  It's like a pincer attack from multiple sides of a deeply intertwined industry.  And content creation is key to overcoming it.  

The great hope for them is their rapid growth, bucket loads of cash, and ability to adapt more quickly to shifts in technology.  I think adaptability will be key, but we're seeing signs here that they are struggling with it.   They're probably finding that their technical capability which worked so well up to this point might not have equipped them to introduce the same sort of innovation to creative processes that build content like great television shows.  

But, yeah, although they've had a great year and are still growing, that growth has slowed.  There's so much more interesting stuff to say about this topic..  spinning the article (via selective information scope and omission) to match a less accurate but more click-grabby title is laziness or incompetence to such a degree that it borders deception.

463,i5kpw74,t3_u7xqd8,"Netflix made six major mistakes I can think of:

1.)They didn't lock down established IP when they had a chance.  They rented, rather than bought.  Now, maybe not every IP holder would have sold in perpetuity, but enough probably would have ... especially if it wasn't exclusive, to make a big difference.  Bit by bit Netflix basically lost the entirety of their worthwhile movie library and most of their television library (AMC excluded).  

2.)They tried to pivot into their own in-house movie and TV production, and unlike a company like HBOMax or Disney, they don't have an established creative hierarchy that knows what the fuck they're doing.  They basically paid hundreds of millions of dollars for unending garbage.  What's even worse, they continuously canceled shows they had created before their runs had ended ... which creates a cycle of pissed off customers unwilling to invest their time in the next show for fear it will also be axed early. 

3.)They raised prices and cracked down on usability while the service got worse.  Bad combination.

4.)When they began to lose content, they didn't actually pivot into a space where their funding and bandwidth could have allowed them a new way to dominate: news and sports.  Their steadfast decision to remain a rental and production house when their rental wing essentially died (as companies pulled back their IP) has been disastrous.

5.)They decided to become political activists.  Whether you agree or disagree with the socio-political positions they have taken as a company, the reality is that when a corporation takes a stand they're going to make someone mad.  

6.)They didn't return shareholder value in the form of dividends or stock buybacks.  I took a hard look at Netflix back in February or March of this year, thinking I might be buying a dip, but I concluded the stock was still massively overvalued.  I went with WBD (at the time, a combination of T and DISCA) instead.",Overlord1317,1650513264.0,9

Subscription revenue from subscribers and price has steadily risen with two distinct increase spikes in mid 2017 and Q1 2022 at their new rate.

Subsections have not historically dropped off due to price increases.

There have been several quarters in the past that were a near zero rise too.  Q1 20222 just happened to to the first instance below zero.  Q4 2021 was also a higher than average increase, and the negative is likely just dumb luck in timing with more jumping on late Q4 rather than early Q1.

The high volume of media seems...targeted.  There's a huge negative narrative around really mild and entirely inline numbers.

Netflix is still the biggest streaming service by a significant margi margin.  Hulu is much lower and growing slower.  Disney+ is lower but the only one growing faster...because Disney.  HBO and HBO Plus is much lower and nearly flat and stagnant for growth.  Amazon Prime is the only thing that matches Netflix, but Prime also covers many other things besides streaming.

People might complain about spending, but that's also the side of the equation they have full control over.  So the numbers here are deliberate.  The one thing they can't control is subscriptions, and that's STILL inline with the long term trend. AND they're making the most revenue they ever had, today.

But it's dinner' somehow all bad, scary scary, and the stock tanked for...reasons???

When earnings are announced these investors valuation models are updated instantly and say ""now NFLX is worth $X"" and the computers start to adjust by buying and selling to adjust their portfolio. Its totally instantaneous. If it happened during market hours then the same thing would happen. A computer would offer 50,000 shares 12% below the bid and clean out the book and the stock would move accordingly as the model says the stock is worth 12% less. The fact that it still bounces around some is due to different investors have different models and positions. 

While to us smaller traders/investors it seems like the reaction is sever and instant there is actually a lot of evidence that it takes a few days/weeks for this new information to play out and settle at its true new value.

While I agree that a loss of subscribers is horrible, it was also after a HUGE amount of new subscriptions due to the pandemic. 

Netflix estimates that 100m non-subscribers are using Netflix accounts, and they seem to have a plan to attempt to monetize those users.

Content owners were letting Netflix use their content for a fee. And over time the larger content owners have placed large and mostly successful bets on making their content exclusive to their platforms (and removing it from Netflix). Over that time Netflix has ramped up their own content generation business and that will likely keep them solvent for a while, but the massive growth days are over.  They are a content company now, not a platform company. And in the long run places like Disney or paramount have been in the content business for much longer and know how to make/buy good enough content in a financially constrained environment. Netflix will have to show similar abilities to compete financially. 

Tesla has succeeded on its own products from the start. I don’t think they will continue to have a valuation higher than all other auto OEMs combined, but I don’t think they’ll need to shift what their business focuses on fundamentally the way Netflix is having to.

I don't think you understand how Bond Prices work. They're inversely related to interest rates - so with the expectation interest rates are going to increase, their prices fall. Obviously. This means that Coupon Rates have to increase - or you can buy Bonds when you think Interest Rate Increases are priced in. Then, wait for the next round of Interest Rate Decreases and sell them for a profit. So, yeah... Bonds are fairly attractive right now....

>Netflix and Facebook are still growth companies, their earnings quality is only improving, and they have IMMENSE pricing power that they've only begun to tap into

Yes, Netflix, a company that lost 200,000 Subscribers - the first time it's lost subscribers in 10 Years - is obviously a growth company. Facebook faces incredibly political headwinds and it's growth is slowing. You can be optimistic about its push into the Metaverse - but their core business model is stalling. You'd have to look at their other operations. But, again, biggest factor is regulation for Facebook.

>So-called 'investors' firmly believe that staples are the place to be right now, because 'interest rates' and 'inflation'.

Uh... Yeah... Interest rates signal contractionary macroeconomic policy - literally reducing aggregate demand and curtailing investment spending. It is a signal that the macroeconomy is overheating and a general pullback is needed. This means Consumer Staples are considered a relative safe place to put money - because they are generally Recession Proof.

>Inflation is good for corporate profitsInflation requires higher interest rates

Inflation is temporarily good for corporate profits - but it also depends on what kind of inflation. Demand Pull inflation is good, Cost Push inflation is bad. The overwhelming majority of inflation is Cost Push which is terrible for margins. Corporate Profits are a lagging indicator and what you really need to look at going forward are Profit Margins. You should be expecting them to shrink as Input Costs continue to increase.

Higher interest rates ARE A LITERAL CATASTROPHE FOR BONDS

I already commented on this - they're terrible if you already owned Bonds which is why people are selling them. They're attractive once the market incorporates Interest Rate Expectations. Once you feel the Bond Market has priced in expected Interest Rate Hikes they would be a great buy since you'll get a high Coupon Rate and also can sell them in the future during the next Easing Cycle

The answer is to own quality assets, which are companies with strong cash flows, moats, network effects, etc.

Which.... would be Consumer Staples....

>People calling this tech bubble 2.0 are either too young to understand what the tech bubble was, or too stupid to understand what it was.

Growth Companies rely on Consumer Discretionary and Easy Liquidity to finance expansion and growth - both of which are drying up fast. I'm not going to go into every company you mentioned, but when inflation is high, there is contractionary monetary policy, and real wages are shrinking, there is no reason to expect Consumer Discretionary will do well. If your real wages are shrinking and you need to spend more money on Consumer Staples (Groceries, Toiletries, Gasoline) you have less money to spend on things you'd normally get from Amazon. You're more likely to cancel your Netflix Account and spend that extra $15 on gas or something else.

So some companies’ share prices are lower or flat, but valuation or premium you pay for a share is higher. Some companies’ prices are higher, but the company actually outperformed and the valuation has become more attractive even with a higher share price.

Like, I think Apple is overvalued right now at a PE of 26, but even I don't think Apple is going to crash 80% from ATH.  At ATH, its PE was 32.  Historical PE floor is 10.  So even with that extreme multiple compression, current EPS puts the floor at 61.5, which would be a 66% drop based on nothing but sentiment.

To get to -80% (36.49), you have to get a 66% multiple drop and a 40% earnings drop.  That would take an utter catastrophe that quite frankly...look...even as a bear myself, you just can't predict that kind of catastrophe, so there's no point in even considering it or trying to plan for it, because you'll be paralyzed by fear *always*, because there's *always* the possibility that everything will blow up in your face.

A reasonable expectation would be another 10-25% down from here in the broad market, varying by the type of company or industry.  You can't point to anything fundamental or statistical to justify a fear of anything greater than that.  To be sure--it could still happen, absolutely.  But you cannot be *reasonably* fearful of that, in my opinion.

As an aside: Netflix is a different story.  Anyone with half a lick of sense could reasonably say that its continued expansion was implausible, due to a huge number of competitors in the media space, and that a PE of 60 was way too much. That was a perfectly reasonable position to take, and look, it panned out.  But Netflix hasn't crashed due to the market going tits-up--it's crashed because a lot of folks came to their senses and started valuing it as what it is: a media company.

Google and Microsoft are nothing like Netflix.  So I do NOT see a repeat.   Google has an actual moat where Netflix really never did.   Same with Microsoft.   Google has multiple moats that are very deep.

Netflix is in a tough position with so much competition.   Which also then increases the cost of acquiring content.

It's kinda funny to see people talking about valuations here while seemingly ignoring the fact that companies like TSM, QCOM, AMAT, AMD, and NVDA have literally grown their revenues by over 30% in the last year while improving margins.  AMD alone grew 68% (not including XLNX).  

QCOM (who grew revenue by 30%) sees automotive as moving from a 1B market to a 10B market by the end of the decade.  They are also trading at a forward PE less than 15 with strong FCF.  

TSMC's CEO in the last earnings call called out that what's different today is amount of silicon content per 'device'.  Even if we sell just as many PCs/phones next year as the last... there are more chips and more expensive chips in each device.  We are also starting up a 5G CapEx cycle.

The bigger deal is going to be how the world handles mass adoption of EVs and chargers.  The typical EV has 4x the amount of silicon content per car than the typical ICE car and as more enter the ecosystem there will be increased computing needs to improve the intelligence of the electrical grid.

These are usually unprofitable companies, which reached sky-high valuations on pure speculation in 2020/21. Most likely their stock prices will correct to some reasonable levels sometimes in the future either by the companies increasing their revenue or the stock price falling. Some of them already corrected. First you should read Burton J. Malakiel's A random walk through Wall street and Peter (not David) Lynch's One up Wall street! Both devote entire chapters to these irrational bubbles and how stocks behave under these circumstances.  The catch is that during the investing mania phase these stocks perform incredibly well, as investors build air castles and buy them like crazy. However when the mania dies off, their shares tumble without any kind on support, since they were not that good companies to begin with. They bring the most profit, when you buy them relatively cheap and then sell them when the price starts to deteriorate.

Your stocks reflect this exact problem. Most of these companies generate losses. Nio, Eyes, Joby, Sofi, Aht, Btx, Cpe, Spce, Dkng, Fubo, Amc, Clov, are all generating losses. These stock's valuations are simply based on hopes that in the foreseeable future they will grow/improve to the point that they will make some profits.

In the old days, investors like Malakiel and Lynch advised, that a PE of over 15 is an extremely risky bet on any stock. This rule most likely faded, you can only buy tobacco companies that cheap nowadays. Still, the PE of Tesla being \~300, MP being 59, these are extremely high even in today's markets. The average PE sits around 40 now. The only reasonably priced paper in this portfolio is Rlx, with a PE of 25. Arkg and Arkk invest their money into the same category of stocks, they will follow the performance of your other stocks closely.

You have several paths you can take from here, the choice most likely depending on your predictions on market behavior. None of us can tell you what will happen in the future, you have to rely on your own assessment of the situation.

1. If you think that this is a transitory phenomenon and these stocks will increase to their previous levels, hold them and simply wait until your portfolio increases in value.
2. If you think that this is the market crash that people have been expecting for a time, then sell everything and put the money into treasury bonds.
3. If you think this is just a routing of the more speculative excess, you can sell everything and put your money into sp500 index funds hoping that the contagion will not reach the larger companies.
4. If you think this contagion only affects tech stocks,  you can sell everything and put the money into value index funds. That way you can avoid the tech collapse.
5. If you think this is a unique phenomenon on the US stock market, you can put your money into an ETF containing foreign stocks. You can even choose, which contry or region to invest your money.

None of us have a crystal ball, we do not know for certain what will happen. We can only make educated guesses about the stock market.  That is the inherent risk in investing.",Durumbuzafeju,1642841962.0,659

The prospect of doubling your money may sound daunting. Given enough years, you have an *outstandingly* good chance to do just that. The trick is to adjust your idea of how long that takes.

The stock market slowly rises over the long term - something like 8% per year if you reinvest your dividends. So here's a little math exercise. Take 1.08 and multiply it by 1.08. That represents two years of gains. Keep multiplying by 1.08 and you see that it doubles in 9 years. In 18 years it doubles twice. 27 years, three times, 36 years four times etc.

Here's the thing though : three doubles is not 2+2+2; it's 2x2x2. So three doubles multiplies your money by 8. Four doubles multiplies your money by 16. If you are young enough that you can invest for 45 years, you will multiply your money by 32 times!

You don't have to hit home runs to make a lot of money in the stock market. You can make an absolute killing in the market just hitting singles if you give it enough time.

So what does it mean to ""hit singles""? Don't pressure yourself to keep up with the latest hot company. Have a broad basket of stocks where a few of them are cool and sexy, but most are boring but profitable. Examples could be retailers, banks and insurers, manufacturers, home builders, truck/train, utilities, real estate (REITs), and many more.

If you like the idea of investing but you want to let someone else pick the stocks, get an S&P index etf like SPY.

You can do this! Don't give up!

I'm a holder - and I don't expect a smooth '22.  But I'm holding.  And if by chance Wednesday brings a drop - I may double down... as long as the thesis holds, which I believe it will.",RockChalkWalk,1650678047.0,66
1027,i5u5jay,t3_u9tddr,"I posted this in r/Investing yesterday and I think it’s relevant here, too:

I’ve bought [22,000](https://imgur.com/a/RVNolb0) shares of Meta in the past 8 weeks. They are criminally undervalued and I’m happy to take scared money. It’s FCF machine, growing at double digits, sitting on a $60B war chest. 

You need to do your own due diligence, and when one makes a seven figure trade, the due diligence is pages long. But I'll add just a few notes beyond Big Blue’s ad biz:

It’s got one of the cleanest, if not the strongest, balance sheets in all of America. I’m on mobile so I’d have to go back later and check my notes, but I had the intrinsic value of $FB roughly at >$410. 

If a “bad” quarter, regularly scheduled poor guidance from a sandbagger of a CFO, a war between two countries that have the GDP of Italy and the threat of a measly 25 bps rate rise want to scare the market into selling me the stock at a 50% discount, I will *literally* buy millions of it. Gladly.

They haven't even monetized WhatsApp, which has 2B+ reach in the world. I'm not sure Americans understand how reliant places like India and Brazil are on WhatsApp. You literally order food, get a cab and speak with your doctor via WhatsApp. It's essentially a public utility for most of the world. And it continues to grow. Yet the money faucet hasn't been turned on. There is likely tens of billions yet to be tapped into here.

Threats of TikTok were overstated (intentionally), Reels isn't yet monetized (Instagram continues to grow), growth of Blue (Facebook's core product) were in line (it's gotta saturate at some point). Yes, iOS 14 privacy changes hurt, but there are ways of aggregating data on the backend using personal identifiers as a way of building your ad profile. This will take time, but they will continue to grow, despite what legendary sandbagger CFO Wehner says. And keep in mind, Meta doesn't sell your data, they sell targeting. People love to misquote this. And the talent they have at the company, my god, is the best in the Valley.

Lastly, I don't care if you love him or hate him, Zuck will go down as one of the greatest capital allocators of all time: buying Instagram for $1B and which is now worth well over $100B, buying WhatsApp for a paltry $19B which essentially owns messaging worldwide and is the world's communication utility (except for the US, which they are trying to break into (did you see the ads during the AFC Championship game)) and now the Metaverse. Google and Microsoft are bleeding top talent to Meta to build the Metaverse which will be CapEx heavy for years. Meta is lightyears ahead in this space. And don't get it twisted - while you may not use the Metaverse, Gen Z will (in ways, they already are) and they will spend money in it. It is the future whether you like it or not.

(Also, good fucking luck, Lina Khan)

I could go on forever about Meta....

Do I care if FB is down 35% because of people's emotional reaction to one ""bad"" (lol) quarter?

Very low risk, high reward scenario.

I pointed this out yesterday at /r/valueinvesting. The CEO David Zazlav with Discovery recently took an Options compensation package that totals 246 million (he made 37 million last year); however, the package doesn't start to trigger until the stock price goes above $36.00. Currently trades at $27.00. So generating value to shareholders and customers is going to be his top priority for greed's sake.

Always see how CEO's are going to be compensated when shopping for opportunities.

Its easy to get wrapped up in this, but before you decide to buy or sell, ask yourself this: what is the goal of your investment account? How much money do you plan to make over what period of time? What is your risk appetite?

They will make more over all by pricing some out and doubling $$ from the 80% that keep the service.

The real question is can they keep making hits that will sell at a higher premium per month and or with ads. I figure I got my initial investment out and reinvested. It's worth the gamble for me. ",tangalaporn,1546666378.0,3

1219,htslhpf,t3_saae9x,"We're very sensitive to the next earnings cycle.

I think the nervousness/fragility because of the valuation metrics like forward P/E ratio (around 21 right now) being very close to the 2000 bubble but still under, and every growth sector having P/E or EV/EBITDA multiples well above their 5 year or even 25 year averages (still, even after a partial correction).

If the big dogs miss revenue next earnings, and depending on how badly, then the true forward P/E ratio right now is more like 25-30 which would make the 2000 comparisons damning.

There is however significant margin growth in the S&P500 of today vs. the S&p500 of the early 2000s.

I also see economists/pundits framing the household low debt/highest savings as positive as misleading and suspicious. High household savings does not mean high demand/spending, especially if there is a lot of fear in the markets. People spend more when they think the market is good because they perceive their wealth to be higher.

But if you avoided the craziest scams like Roku (at its peak I mean), Peloton, Virgin Galactic, you're probably fine.
