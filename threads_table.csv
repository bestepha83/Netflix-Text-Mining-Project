Netflix co-CEO Reed Hastings finally acknowledged what most people outside of the company have been saying for years: In order to keep growing, the company will need to incorporate ads. The executive offered his view on the subject Tuesday after Chief Product Officer Greg Peters addressed the spread in pricing among different territories and subscription plans with a stunning declaration. The execs were speaking on the company’s first-quarter earnings interview, which was posted to YouTube this evening, per quarterly custom. “One way to increase the price spread is advertising on low-end plans and to have lower prices with advertising,” he said. “Those who have followed Netflix know that I’ve been against the complexity of advertising and a big fan of the simplicity of subscription. But as much as I’m a fan of that, I’m a bigger fan of consumer choice. Allowing consumers who would like to have a lower price and are advertising-tolerant get what they want makes a lot of sense. So, that’s something we’re looking at now, we’re trying to figure out over the next year or two. Think of us as quite open to offering even lower prices with advertising as a consumer choice.”

Netflix for years has waved away the mere notion that it would consider rolling out an ad-supported tier. Most of its U.S. competitors, notably newcomers like HBO Max, Disney+ and Peacock, have all been in various stages of adding sponsored messages to lower-priced plans. In the past, Netflix — and Hastings in particular — have cited a host of concerns, including privacy as well as the intricacies of integrating outside brand messages into the company’s well-honed interface. Asked during the call about the task of weaving in advertising to the company’s strategy, Hastings admitted it is “not a short-term fix, because once you start offering a lower-priced plan with ads as an options, some consumers take it. And we’ve got a big installed base that probably are quite happy where they are. It would phase in over a couple of years in terms of being material volume.”",WickedSensitiveCrew,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u7x44b/netflix_has_plans_to_add_commercials_for_some/,1650463015.0,135,109

Another point of focus will be lockdowns in China, which have affected Tesla's production in Shanghai. Credit Suisse analysts estimate that the recent shutdown there prevented the manufacture of 90,000 vehicles.

116,ue6pco,How Netflix can increase its revenues,"I just wrote this email to the investor relations team:

Dear Investor Relations team,

&#x200B;

I am a proud investor of Netflix, currently owning 12 shares. I really like how Netflix developed its high quality services. Since Netflix is struggling at this point, it is time for change.

Netlix management has considered implementing a low tier subscription model including advertisement to increase the profitability of the company. Honestly, I think this is the only way Netflix can continue grow and increase its revenues again. However, the type of advertisement is crucial.

Here is the idea: Often times when my girlfriend and I watch Netflix we notice interesting products during our favorite shows, e.g. a cool smart watch, a nice looking dress or a comfortable couch. Now if we really like the product, we are trying to find the product on the internet to buy it, but often we can not find the product we are looking for. Now here is the deal: Since Netflix is producing its own content, how cool would it be, if they use certain products in their shows (like product placement) and allows the viewer to buy it immediately on Netflix. How? Just pause the video if you like the product, check if this product is available (it should glow or be shiny or whatever so you can click on it), and just be forwarded to a marketplace to buy it (or at least a similar product). Importantly, this feature should be optional, so that you can turn it off in your settings, if you don't want to see any advertisement. 

This would generate a new type of revenue stream, especially since there is a lot of personal bonding to certain types of shows, product placement should be easy and straight forward (e.g. letting the protagonist wear certain type of clothes or jewelry). 

Could you please consider this idea and distribute it to the responsible individuals?

A new finding by money experts at Income-Tax.co.uk reveals that online searches for ‘buy Netflix stock’ skyrocketed 931% to nearly ten times the global average for the past week, in light of falling share prices for the streaming giant Netflix.

The company reported losing 200,000 paid subscribers in its first quarter of trading on Tuesday evening, causing shareholder confidence in the online platform to dip and its share prices to drop by 25%. However, it seems that this has not shaken the confidence of some investors, with many looking to seize this opportunity and get their hands on Netflix shares, as searches for ‘buy Netflix stock’ increased by 931%.

A spokesperson for Income-Tax.co.uk commented on the findings: “While shareholder confidence has dwindled for many in light of Netflix’s drop in subscribers, it appears there has also been a surge in the number of people looking to capitalize on this dip, while share prices are low. It seems that many investors have confidence in the streaming giant to further build upon the success that they have seen during the pandemic.”

The company said for the first quarter of 2022, it expects to add 2.5 million subscribers, compared to the 3.98 million it added in Q1 2021.


Stock drop 20% after hours on January 20th since analysts had estimated increase of 6.93 million users. 

Yesterday they announced the Q1 earnings and we all saw that their own guidance was missed by quite some margin. 

My question is if a publicly trader company should warn investors in advance that they are going to miss their own estimates for the upcoming quarter. (as did Epam after the war in Ukraine broke) 

Sometime in mid February or beginning of March Netflix management should realise that  they will never achieve the 2.5 million new subscribers they estimated just in January.

Can this be used as a class lawsuit action against Netflix by investors who bought in Q1?

>  
> “Squid Game” stands out both for its popularity, and its relatively low cost. The South Korean show, about indebted people in a deadly contest for a cash prize, generated $891.1 million in impact value, a metric the company uses to assess the performance from individual shows. The show cost just $21.4 million to produce -- about $2.4 million an episode. Those figures are just for the first season, and stem from a document that details Netflix’s performance metrics for the show.

One good example is Microsoft (MSFT) buying Activision Blizzard (ATVI) for $69 billion - while it is a massive amount of money I consider it to be a pretty good deal all things considered... And it wouldn't have been possible had the stock been trading at peak (in this case specifically the crash in stock price was more related to internal issues of course, rather than macro)

Could you see something like Shopify (SHOP) being acquired? Or maybe something like Embracer Group (EMBRAC B)? Netflix (NFLX) even?

134,uavfl8,"Google, Meta, and others will have to explain their algorithms under new EU legislation","https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/23/23036976/eu-digital-services-act-finalized-algorithms-targeted-advertising

The EU has agreed on another ambitious piece of legislation to police the online world.

Early Saturday morning after hours of negotiations, the bloc agreed on the broad terms of the Digital Services Act, or DSA, which will force tech companies to take greater responsibility for content that appears on their platforms. New obligations include removing illegal content and goods more quickly, explaining to users and researchers how their algorithms work, and taking stricter action on the spread of misinformation. Companies face fines of up to six percent of their annual turnover for non-compliance.

Although the legislation only applies to EU citizens, the effect of these laws will certainly be felt in other parts of the world, too. Global tech companies may decide it is more cost-effective to implement a single strategy to police content and take the EU’s comparatively stringent regulations as their benchmark. While lawmakers in the US keen to rein in Big Tech with their own regulations have already begun looking to the EU’s rules for inspiration.

The final text of the DSA has yet to be released, but the European Parliament and European Commission have detailed a number of obligations it will contain:

* Targeted advertising based on an individuals’ religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity is banned. Minors cannot be subject to targeted advertising either.

* “Dark patterns” — confusing or deceptive user interfaces designed to steer users into making certain choices — will be prohibited. The EU says that, as a rule, cancelling subscriptions should be as easy as signing up for them.

* Large online platforms like Facebook will have to make the working of their recommender algorithms (e.g. used for sorting content on the News Feed or suggesting TV shows on Netflix) transparent to users. Users should also be offered a recommender system “not based on profiling.” In the case of Instagram, for example, this would mean a chronological feed (as it introduced recently).

* Hosting services and online platforms will have to explain clearly why they have removed illegal content, as well as give users the ability to appeal such takedowns. The DSA itself does not define what content is illegal, though, and leaves this up to individual countries.

* The largest online platforms will have to provide key data to researchers to “provide more insight into how online risks evolve.”

* Online marketplaces must keep basic information about traders on their platform to track down individuals selling illegal goods or services.

* Large platforms will also have to introduce new strategies for dealing with misinformation during crises (a provision inspired by the recent invasion of Ukraine).

The DSA will, like the DMA, distinguish between tech companies of different sizes, placing greater obligations on bigger companies. The largest firm — those with at least 45 million users in the EU, like Meta and Google — will face the most scrutiny. These tech companies have lobbied hard to water down the requirements in the DSA, particularly those concerning targeted advertising and handing over data to outside researchers.

Although the broad terms of the DSA have now been agreed upon by the member states of the EU, the legal language still needs to be finalized and the act officially voted into law. This last step is seen as a formality at this point, though. The rules will apply to all companies 15 months after the act is voted into law, or from 1 January 2024, whichever is later.",ubunturd,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/uavfl8/google_meta_and_others_will_have_to_explain_their/,1650808968.0,355,1833

137,u8fb6r,Tech Stocks Are Absurdly Cheap Now: putting my money where my mouth is,"Buckle in.

Investing isn't easy, and yet people are--and always will--try to act like it is. Just like every other period in stock market history, retail 'investors' are being lazy and emotional and valuing businesses based off the direction their prices are heading rather than long term fundamentals. Volatility is the price you pay for performance. Thinking it's time to sell tech and buy Kellogg, with corporate profits RISING, will get you into deep trouble. 

No, being a good investor has absolutely nothing to do with being 'contrarian'. It just so happens that retail is too lazy and emotional to notice that prices tend to head fake away from where people should be buying at any given timeframe. Sometimes these head fakes point to different asset classes, other times to different assets within any given class. 

Right now, it's both. 

People think tech is in 2001 territory strictly because of price action, when we are in literally the opposite place outside a handful of overvalued and overhyped names; and people think bond yields are becoming attractive, when bonds are in the worst bear market in years (though this could change at any time considering the overreaction we've seen in Fed rate predictions). **This is precisely when you should be buying reasonably priced tech with strong cash flows, pricing power, quality earnings growth, barriers to entry (either a difficult industry to break into or an outright moat, which is very rare and hard to predict but** ***Facebook has one*****), network effects, and demand inelasticity.** Your stocks don't have to have all of these elements, but the more, the merrier. 

**\*\*\***

**Here's some oversimplified but VERY true deductive reasoning that 99% of 'investors' fail to heed:**

\-Companies with higher earnings growth deserve higher valuations  
\-Companies with better pricing power deserve higher valuations  
\-Companies with higher quality earnings growth deserve higher valuations  
\-Netflix and Facebook are still growth companies, their earnings quality is only improving, and they have IMMENSE pricing power that they've only begun to tap into  
\-Proctor & Gamble has a 40% higher relative valuation than Netflix  
\-CAMPBELL'S SOUP has a higher valuation than Facebook  
\-So-called 'investors' firmly believe that staples are the place to be right now, because 'interest rates' and 'inflation'. 

**Okay...**

\-Corporate profits drive stock prices--literally in lock step--over the long run  
\-Inflation is good for corporate profits  
\-Inflation requires higher interest rates  
\-Higher interest rates are a headwind for stocks  
\-Higher interest rates ARE A LITERAL CATASTROPHE FOR BONDS  
\-Holding cash *is basically taking a financial gun and pointing it at your face and pulling the trigger*  
\-The answer is to own quality assets, which are companies with strong cash flows, moats, network effects, etc.

**Millions of retail investors are absolutely convinced that tech is overvalued--but it's not because of poor fundamentals. Honestly, it's not even because of inflation, interested rates, or Ukraine. It's simply because prices are going down.** Do yourself a favor. Look at sentiment from one year ago today. Facebook to $600 was a done deal. Netflix was overpriced, and I wouldn't have bought it at near $700, but if anyone thought we would be below $230, we'd be minting new billionaires by the second because of their OTM puts. Amazon is more underpriced than I've maybe ever seen based off what we can easily see (the market has never understood Amazon, and AWS ALONE is clearly a multitrillion dollar valuation by 2030). 

**FACTS:**

\-**Amazon** PE is lowest ever while its future core businesses--AWS and ads (they are doing more ad revenue than YOUTUBE now, and AWS brings in more profit than any business line now, so if you think Amazon is a retail business you should be buying index funds...)--are growing at 40% or more.   
\-**Facebook** PE is lowest ever--last time this happened was three years ago, their stock price crashed to $131, and with this incredible overreaction they're STILL up 54% since then.   
\-And now to my favorite part: **Netflix** is at its lowest valuation since the 2000s and perhaps ever--who cares before then, it wasn't Netflix, it was a frickin' mail-order DVD company. Its PEG is .84. Its earnings have plateaued on SEVERAL occasions only to leap, over and over again. Just like Facebook, they were bound to hit a plateau for their core use base at some point. But if you think that means they're done growing out earnings--not to mention expanding other business lines, like Amazon did with AWS and ads, and Microsoft did with Azure--you need to ask yourself whether you have enough knowledge and experience here. 

In a way, investing really isn't that hard. **You just have to actually buy businesses and not obsess over the value of your portfolio every day**. If you do that, you're smart enough to see that tech could fall another 30% right now--and it would only present an even better buying opportunity with even more upside. As Buffett said after 2008, he might've been early, but he still got rich. And trust me, buying now might be early, but it will be INSANELY lucrative. 

SO SO SO many companies are just dirt cheap. People think DropBox is a shitty cloud business, when its top line is growing double digits and they're priced like Campbell's f'kn Soup. People think GoPro is a shitty camera business when it has begun adding software with INCREDIBLE margins and is growing rapidly again. Upstart is literally the only company in the market with the triple crown--triple digit growth, massively profitable, and BUYING BACK STOCK--yet its price was cut by 80%. There are just so many tech companies getting caught up in this indiscriminate selling, as if they're DoorDash or Rivian or Nikola or Snowflake, or any of the incredibly overpriced businesses, good or bad, that deserved to be cut in half.  

People calling this tech bubble 2.0 are either too young to understand what the tech bubble was, or too stupid to understand what it was. This is the literal opposite of the tech bubble. We have companies with tens of billions in FCF being repriced as if they're going out of business. Earnings are GROWING. We are in a BOOM cycle--IN TECH. You are being fooled--AGAIN. During the tech bubble, it's not that companies weren't making money...**THEY WEREN'T EVEN BRINGING IN REVENUE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE?** Not even the most overvalued companies today (aside from Rivian and Nikola) can attest to such an atrocity. 

I pity the people who need to see instant green in their portfolios, and I hope to see your sea of !Remind Me! posts for five to ten years from now. **For those of you who take anything away from this post, here's putting my money where my mouth is:**

Here's my portfolio weighted by notional impact--i.e. ITM calls carry more leverage despite moving the same amount as 100 shares of a stock, or ATM short puts I've written to buy at a lower cost basis or just hold the premium. (**I plan on opening a Netflix position at some point soon.**)

**$UPST:** **16.9%** (Pretty much the perfect stock: AI lending company that's barely unaffected by rates and loan origination volume; already profitable by a mile; reinvesting capital into massive TAMs; and already has permission from the board to buy back stock. Hope you don't judge a stock by its PE because that's how you miss pretty much every single winner, from Amazon to Salesforce to Netflix.)  
**$CIM:** **7.7%** (Retracing like a tech stock right now with fortress balance sheet and 12% dividend yield--and climbing. Chimera did even better following the pandemic after cutting its dividend yield, which made for the perfect time to buy.)  
**$OSTK:** **7.54%** (Retail furniture business that's stealing market share from Wayfair and growing rapidly yet with a stock price selling as if it's going out of business--oh yeah, and they've got Medici Ventures, which is priced at zero.)  
**$Z: 6.56%** (Vertically integrated media business of which people seem to have zero understanding. It's literally in the best shape it's ever been: shed of its worst business segment and raising capital from home inventory; growing at over 20%; and selling at a 75%+ discount...yet people hate it infinitely more than when it was up near $200...LOL)  
**$AMZN: 5.97%** (Enough said above. This is a multitrillion dollar business that checks every box listed above selling at less than half its true value.)   
**$APPS:** **5.25%** (Growing triple digits, profitable, and with insane barriers to entry--not quite Upstart, but this is a 5x play.)  
**$URI:** **5.12%** (Picks and shovels play for infrastructure boom ahead. Someone will pass a version of build back better, and this company is a gem even without government subsidy. Also, United Rentals helps balance out my insanely tech-weighted portfolio just a tad bit, though that's not at all why I bought it--because I could care less how much money I lose in the short term to maximize long term gains.)  
**$FB:** **5.2%** (The greatest network company of all time--a company whose business model will never be repeated--is trading at a multiple 7% lower than the Campbell f'kin Soup Company. Enough said.)  
**$CLSK:** **4.71%** (One of the fastest growing companies in the world; already profitable; ESG sustainable Bitcoin miner; QUADRUPLE DIGIT GROWTH on the top line; trading at a SINGLE DIGIT forward PE--crashing as if both they and Bitcoin are going to zero.)  
**$STNE:** **4.37%** (A big boo-boo in their long book and concerns about the Brazilian economy are apparently enough to crash the stock over 90%. Like several other stocks on this list, earnings give a HUGE temporary boost because of how incredibly strong they are, only to watch the gains wither away because of indiscriminate selling in the tech space.)  
**$AMAT: 3.14%** (Picks and shovels play for the semiconductor bull market that will last for decades to come. Probably the only company on this list that I'd call fairly valued, but it's such a great company it's worth every penny.)  
**$PLTR: 3.09%** (It's apparently fun to hate Palantir because it was a meme stock. But if you can do math, 30% compound interest for 10 years does not a meme stock make. Probably the only stock on this list that I might even call *over*priced, but I also think it's worth every penny with a smaller position.)  
**$AMD: 2.97%** (Trading as if China is going to invade, tear down TSM, collapse the market for chips, and send interest rates to 50%. Beyond idiotically cheap.)  
**$MU: 2.85%** (Micron's pricing power is unmatched in this industry. Very few companies do what they do and none do it as well--and they're trading for pennies on the dollar.)  
**$DBX: 2.66%** (Apparently it's cool to hate Drew Houston? I don't know, but in addition to what was mentioned above, this company is set to buy back half it's MFing float. Like, are you kidding me?)  
**$NVDA: 2.61%** (Only reason I don't have a bigger allocation is because NVIDIA puts my total semi allocation at around 9%. I also owned Intel for a hot second before I rolled it into other plays. Think The whole space is going to continue to skyrocket, but no one has the creativity or talent that NVIDIA does.)  
**$BNTX: 2.6%** (The market thinks that this company stumbled upon vaccines, that covid is ending tomorrow, and that they have no other pipeline. The reality is that BioNTech is set to sell billions more in vaccines for a long time coming, and all of this is an incredibly massive tailwind to their rare diseases pipeline.)  
**$WBD: 2.22%** (It's always funny when some jackoff at BoA comes out with a report about how the merger between Discovery and Warner Brothers will create synergies that make this a $45 stock--6 months after the deal is announced. The stock rocketed above $30, then was indiscriminately sold off back to where it started--for no reason. The market is so efficient.)  
**$GPRO: 2.2%** (As mentioned above, this has become a software company with total control over its market and prices. 96% of action cameras in America are GoPros. The recurring revenue on that software makes this at least a $30 stock. But nobody wants to own it because RemEmBEr tHat TiME WheN iT SolD OfF?)  
**$NOK: 2.1%** (5G is them and some other guy. Enough said.)  
**$CRM: 1.81%** (This company does not stop growing. One of the best companies in the world and there is no end in sight. Personally think the Slack purchase is being totally swept under the rug. It's just that time of the cycle when you're supposed to doubt Benioff.)  
**$NLST: 1.33%** (Very unknown memory company with massive lawsuits against a bevy of huge companies and great prospects outside those lawsuits. They settled the lawsuit with SK Hynix and still have pending cases for patent infringement against the likes of Samsung, Micron, and Google--all of which are entirely legitimate.)  
**$AMRS: 0.8%** (A deep future play for molecules-as-a-function. This one is very nuanced and I'm getting tired of writing. You'd have to look into this one yourself to truly understand the importance of synthetic, sustainable molecules used in the place of limited and/or endangered organics at far cheaper prices across the cost spectrum.)  
**$SFT: 0.29%** (Kind of a random little lottery bet on a company with a market cap lower than its fourth quarter revenue alone. But with no path to profitability in sight, that's all it is: a lottery ticket with a VERY small amount of AUM allocated.) 

*It's not possible to create a perfect weighting with options in your portfolio, especially short puts, but I've done the best I can. For example, notionally, I could be tied to even more* ***Upstart*** *than I've represented here. But Upstart would have to be ITM across three separate strikes (70, 80, and 100) by January 2023, which nobody can predict. (What I can say is that anything under $100 is DIRT cheap for Upstart, so I'm more than happy to own it at about $51, $55, and $66, which would be the breakeven prices at each strike, respectively, when including the outrageous premium I was paid for writing these puts.) I split the notional values of being assigned each put in half to represent the fact that Upstart is currently ITM for my 100 puts, ATM for the 80, and OTM for 70. Arbitrary, but so is anything in this case, even if you'd use Black Scholes somehow.*",FastAssSister,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u8fb6r/tech_stocks_are_absurdly_cheap_now_putting_my/,1650515580.0,567,918

Netflix Inc. (NFLX) said it added more subscribers than it  predicted in the latest quarter as profit and revenue rose thanks to the return  of popular series and new hits.

The Los Gatos,  Calif.-based streaming company said third-quarter profit increased to  $1.45 billion from $790 million a year earlier.  Per-share earnings were $3.19 a share, compared with  $1.74 a share last year, topping GAAP earnings estimates of  $2.56 a share, according to FactSet.

Revenue rose to $7.48 billion from $6.44  billion a year earlier and was in line with analysts' expectations.

The streaming service said it added roughly **4.4** million memberships in the  third quarter.   The new additions bring Netflix's(NFLX) total paid global subscriber base  to 213.6 million

It had previously forecast it would add 3.5 million memberships.

Netflix (NFLX) also said it would change how it discloses  viewership information. It currently reports on the number of accounts that  watched at least two minutes of a show. Going forward, it will instead pivot to  hours viewed for its titles.

 Netflix (NFLX) earlier this year said it would make its own  video games, part of an effort to expand into new revenue streams. The company  said the games would be made for mobile devices, and some of them may feature  characters from Netflix(NFLX) shows and movies. The games will be  included at no extra cost to Netflix(NFLX) members.

Another report I read earlier mentioned that Youtube has paid over $30B to creators over the last 2-3 years (all those annoying unskippable ads doing some good perhaps).

One edge that Youtube has is that they don't have to pay creators upfront like Netflix does. They only share revenue upon monetization. It makes them a very cashflow friendly business that's growing 35-40%.

Maybe more importantly, the gaming consumer is simply a different consumer - one that would much rather own a game forever than rent it or have access to it via a subscription. Gamers want their own Xbox, their PS5, their Switch, their PC, and they want to buy or download games that they then own as property. It’s just not the same thing as television media.

\-------------

I haven't posted in a while due to personal circumstances but I've been reading along regularly in the daily posts and sharing in all your tales of joy and suffering.

I want to put forward a random epic rant about some stuff that's in my mind currently. This isn't really structured, just, what comes to mind as I think about the market today, thoughts circulating around the last month or two. Maybe someone will find it interesting.

# Time & Experience

Keep in mind, I'm a much older investor than most of you, that doesn't make me a better investor (in fact, the last 18 months, and the period from 2015-2020 have been a shit time to be a bear!), but it means I've lived through stuff that is just old tales in the history books for you.

Part of that is about understanding the experience of loss, part of it is expanding your idea of what's possible. I mean, if I built a time machine, went back and told you in November, ""Netflix will fall from $700 to $250 within months, and yet, no one will be rushing to buy it, in fact it will then keep dropping some more the next day"", you would have laughed at me a lot and pointed out how Squid Game was currently the most popular show in the world and netflix was an amazing growth stock with limitless potential. That was just six months ago, when people lived in that version of reality. Inflation was high then, but it was 'transitional', rates were 0%, there was no need for rate rises, the housing market was continuing up at blistering pace. Mortgage rates in the USA were 2.5% for a 30 year loan. Europe was at peace. Picking up the paper, no one was discussing where a nuke might land. Delta was a pain in the butt but we seemed to be getting finally through the worst of covid, at the start of november, omicron was barely on the radar, omicron B2, XE, 98, ME, 2000, or Omicron 11 Professional Edition didn't even exist. That was just six months ago!

If that much can change in the last six months, imagine what it will look like six months in the future, just try to imagine! It's like the blind spot in your field of vision. Your instincts will say 'pretty much the same as today, perhaps a linear extension of the trends we see today'. But actually we could be really very far from that. There could be a major earthquake somewhere, war could get a LOT worse, new disease can show up, rates might have to rise above inflation to control it, inflation could *keep* rising rapidly, there could be a currency crisis, a crypto wipeout, a new technology might be discovered (like MRNA vaccines) that suddenly and rapidly changes the game for humanity. The 'mood' of the world might change, grow more gloomy, the markets may crash through the floor to a degree that seems as impossible to you today, just as impossible as Netflix $220, or tens of thousands of US military volunteers travelling to fight for the future of Ukrainian democracy against the real threat of Russian nukes would have seemed to you in November 2021. Nonetheless, things happen, totally regardless of what we each believe is the range of possible futures. Our personal models of the future fail again and again, yet we each retain absolute confidence in them somehow and always think 'the next 6 months will be mostly just like today, except maybe some musician will get married or die or something'. If you want to make God laugh, tell him about your plans, or about your views on the future.

# A lot of people don't even know themselves yet

You can train soldiers for years but they won't know till they're in combat what combat actually feels like, or how they'll react to it. Similarly, you could read this forum all day, read buffett's letters, read AMD's earnings report, read books, watch youtubes or tiktoks or whatever, trade all you like in a happy, upwards, safe market. But there's literally nothing that will prepare you for the cold hard ninja-nut-punch when you realise 80% of your money is just... gone. It isn't coming back. It's too late. You've fucked it up. You *can't* unfuck it. A decade or two of grind in a shit job you hate is the only way back. I speak from experience. I've been there. It permanently changed how I invest and made me a hyper-cautious scaredy-bear for life. Making money in a euphoric bubble vs losing money in a brutal crash, is like the difference between having fun in the bedroom with someone, vs having a baby burst out so forcefully and painfully that the entire lower body instantly rips open all the way round from front to back. Experience gained from one is not a teacher for the other.

Like the moment your doctor tells you that you have cancer. I've been there. Like the moment a one-night-stand texts you she's pregnant and not getting an abortion, (thankfully avoided this one). You can't know who you are, till you're actually standing there experiencing it. Living in a new type of experience. No amount of bookwork or pre-thought or imagination will show you who'll you be in that moment. That feeling of 'hmmm... shit.' you feel looking at the market dumping today or netflix losing 36% and then losing so more %s after that.... this is not the end, it is only barely the *beginning* of the experience you're going to have one day, and probably very soon. It is the pre-appetiser nibble, not even the appetiser, certainly not the main course. I'm afraid to say, new investors, that you are only seeing the oh-shit seagull balanced on the tip of the oh-shit iceberg through your telescope. By 'new investors' I mean anyone who joined the market in the last 22 years.

# 22 years??? wtf?

Yes. 22 years. That's when the last proper secular bear market began. 2018 and 2020 were corrections. Technically, 2020 qualified as a bear by depth of crash, but it was not a real bear market. 2008 was a proper decent bear market, but not the start of a secular bear, just a piece of an existing one. A secular bear is when you put your money in and don't see those levels again for over a decade. A secular bear is a total nightmare for anyone who's not a value investor (because value investors don't really care much about the market's opinion anyway). 2000 qualifies, because it took til 2015 for most QQQ / SP500 investors to get back what they put in. Corrections and crashes are about sudden, painful losses, but you can easily just take a nap and wait them out unless you trade options (very common now, not common in the past). We used to see 10% corrections almost every year, sometimes several, but all the easy money and mania and euphoria has made all dips shallow in the last 6 years excluding Dec 2018 and Mar 2020.

Bear markets are about brutal losses, they drive margin-users out of the market and give everyone else a big fright / buying opportunity for a year or two.

But secular bears? Holy fuck. Secular bears are just a different game. Secular bears, you wait a month, you wait a year, you wait 3 years, you wait 5 years. Jesus christ I'm still down 50%!. You wait 10 years, oh my god I'm still down. You wait 15-20 years, oh jesus, finally! finally! I can sell and get my money back! Secular bears are when you write a letter to yourself reminding future you of why Chewy, Rivian or GME truly is an amazing company and definitely not to sell it, then 8 years later, you find the letter in a box in the attic (having long since lost interest in investing), you read it, laugh a little, cry a lot, and then you either burn the letter or frame it.

If your child is born the very first day of the start of a secular bear market, your first grandchild may be getting born by the time you get your money back out from the market. Look at the 1930->1950s secular bear for example. Secular bears make society stop talking about stock investing completely, it becomes taboo at first, then just, not interesting. No one cares. We are very far away from that stage of the market!

But from a CAPE 40 (January), that's what you'd expect to see in the next 10 years, from all the historical data, you should expect a secular bear to be beginning. Rates rising, QT, inflation, supply/demand crisis, labour costs rising, epic bubbles in housing, bonds, crypto, stocks, growth going ex-growth, hype losing it's hype - sorry folks, but we are going straight towards a secular bear whether you want it or not. It's just how it is. Ask yourself, how many people do you know that are actually prepared emotionally and financially for multiple years of grinding losses, like 2000 or 2008? For decades of stagnation? Like 2000-2015 and 1930-1950s?

Look up the DJIA from 1934-1950. Look it up from 1966 to 1982. Look it up from 2000 to 2016. This 'secular bear' thing is not an imaginary concept. It comes around every few decades, and it ruins the lives of all the investors who hate history books.

Your great-grandparents lived through several secular bears, your grandparents too, your parents too. It's just part of the human experience. Now, it is probably going to be your turn to experience your first secular bear. Whatever happens next, it will not be like the fun and games of the last 24 months, I assure you.

# The euphoria is clearly starting to fade.

We're now several months since a new all-time high in the indices was last reached. The emotions that replace euphoria aren't 'hope' or 'resoluteness', they're 'boredom', 'frustration', 'despair'. The emotions that follow after those ones are 'caution', 'panic', 'fear'.

Long-term market price comes from company value, but short-term it comes from waves of people changing from buyers to holders, holders to sellers or vice versa. An imbalance between people wanting to buy or sell is the force that creates bubbles and crashes. And we're seeing a change of balance taking place currently, though it comes in waves, as people flip-flop back to greed one week, fear the next. But long-term, the euphoria is clearly draining away. The thing about euphoria is that when you lose it, it doesn't quickly come back. The thing about fear is, when you get it, it doesn't quickly go away.

We'll eventually pass through 'selling from caution', 'selling from boredom', 'selling from fear', and will then reach 'forced selling'. Where people just have to close positions because they were running on margin, or they put more into the stockmarket than was wise and have to meet some household expenses, or whatever. You'll recognise it because *everything* goes down. Even safe-haven stocks losing 5%. People get to the point they simply can't manage the emotional pain caused by seeing losses after losses. Unfortunately (for bulls), the more that bulls convert to bears (or are forcibly converted by their broker or wife/husband), the less fun it is to be a bull going forward for years to come. As a classical-value investor, I hate to say it, but short & long-term momentum is a real effect, and it's driven by human psychology.

# The fall is still beginning

With hype stocks, memes, spacs etc, we may see a 2000 style market overvaluation. I have a 'pick the right meme stock!' book on my bookshelf from 2000, telling you the hot stocks to buy. It's quite amusing. We didn't call them meme stocks then, just 'internet stocks' or 'dotcoms'. And we didn't have Buttcorn, we had Flooz. But you get the idea.

With an overpriced housing market, we see 2008 style market overvaluation, 'flipping' etc.

With bonds priced all the way down to <1% rates on the 30y not long ago, we saw a new type of market overvaluation, which is now rapidly correcting.

All of which coincided with short rates & QE being the driving factors. Now both of these are in reverse. Let's suppose we get only one of those bubbles turning to a crash, and not all three running together.

2000-2002: We saw the nasdaq decline 78%. Currently, it's only declined 18%.

**In other words, as of today, April 21st, we're just 1/8th of the way to replaying the last tech hype bubble drop.**

18% drop from peak -> 82% left

18% drop from there -> .82 x .82 = 67% left

18% drop again -> 55% left

18% drop again -> 45% left

18% drop again -> 37% left

18% drop again -> 30% left

18% drop again -> 25% left

18% drop again -> 20% left

So, we would need to see another 7 similar dumps of 18% in the nasdaq like the one from November 2021 peak to today, in addition to the drops already happened, to replay the 2000-2002 tech/hype/meme crash. Stop and think about that for a moment if you're investing in these stocks. The 'bummer' feeling you have today is 1/8 of what you may have by the end. You will go through this again, and again, and still not even be halfway through the suffering.

# Nah it won't happen

Now you will all have lots of reasons why 'that can't happen again, this time is different' etc. Copium is a real psychological effect, read up on 'the five stages of grief bargaining' etc. But load up the share price charts for your favourite memes and scroll back to 2015-2016.

Let's take netflix as an example. Netflix in 2012 was $7. In 2015, $47. 2016? $85. And that was *without* a market crash backdrop, and without competition, without 'the end of customer growth'. That was a company with a basic perfect future ahead, lots of customers to be discovered, that was how it was priced in a market not facing QT and rate rises, tax rises, rising labour costs, etc. None of which is true any more.

The idea of netflix dropping another, say, 33% from here shouldn't seem unreasonable. $150 netflix would put it on a PER equal to the long-term US average for ex-growth, non-monopoly companies around PER 15. Also sort of matches the 2000 dotcom price drop. Besides, a further 33% drop in netflix shouldn't seem THAT weird when we literally had a 36% drop happen out of nowhere literally 2 days ago.

Or how about AMD? The last few years it enjoyed a lack of performance competition from intel. Now, it's competing with Apple, with Amazon/Google data warehouse custom chips, it's competing with nvidia in graphics (who are winning), and intel is winning on both price and performance again in the x86 consumer market. The only place AMD are still hanging on is x86 server performance, and not for long. 3D chips have not been the outrageous victory hoped for this year either.

AMD is in a technologically inferior and substantially financially weaker position than Intel. We should expect their share PERs to be much closer together. Intel's PER is about 10-13 (depending on where earnings come in soon). Even viewing AMD as 'going ex hyper-growth, exiting the glory years, room to still grow share' you'd maybe put it on a 15-18 PER.

Let's take the highest analyst forward earnings estimate for 2022 and price that with a 15 PER, higher than intels. ([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amd/earnings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amd/earnings)). That's 3.78 earnings x 15 per = 56.7$. That's not even crash pricing. That's pricing for 'return to normality'. If we do the 'nasdaq dumped 78% in the last tech crash' assumption and apply to AMD's peak price, we get $164 peak, x 0.22 = $36. Even in the last 12 months, AMD was priced at $72.50. In 2020, <$40.

So whichever point of view you take, there's a lot of air still underneath these prices potentially.

And yet AMD and Netflix are about as good as it gets for overall company quality, duopoly, and potential growth among the tech hype meme bubble darlings. If AMD and netflix holders may have heavy bags for years to come, what happens to all the purely-meme crap holders?

Can it happen? Sure it can. Look at the Intel, Microsoft share prices between 2000 to 2015, Cisco etc. These were the technology hype darlings of the time. It really happens. It can take literally 20+ years to get your money back out again.

# Mortgage rates.

US mortgage rates were around 2.5% for 30 years merely 4 months ago.

Recently they've been over 6%. If you assume most people 'buy as much house as they can afford for a monthly payment', then that equates to every $500k house becoming a $400k house, even absent a recession or any other factors like change of housebuyer sentiment in the market. It seems to me a lot of people haven't figured this out. [r/rebubble](https://www.reddit.com/r/rebubble/) has more.

Likewise, in Australia and Canada, did you know that most mortgages are adjustible rate (around 90% in both cases, though less among the most recent mortgages). In the past, short-rates had to rise above inflation to control inflation, eg over 10% rates. Can you imagine what these two countries will look like with 10% rates? Personally, I surely would not be investing in Australian or Canadian banks right now.

Of course, banks make more money long-term when rates are high, usually, but they tend to suffer crippling short-term losses during the period of 'rates becoming high' beforehand. It's like the difference between simply having a muscular physique and the pain you have to go through to get there at first. Hence, we see banks making significantly increased loss provisions currently. I expect to see bank stocks get slammed pretty hard this year, even more than we've seen already. JPM & BAC are about as good as it gets globally for banking, but my price target on JPM for example is around $90, which is more in line with historical lows for the stock given growth over the years. For BAC I'd struggle to persuade myself to pay above $20-25. The thing is, I remember just how bad it got in the 2008 crash for banks. Last time around I saw Citigroup drop 99% from peak at one point, in 2008. Which wasn't the worst of it. I watched half the banking sector completely go out of business in months here. I saw major international banks dropping 40% off their share price in minutes on no news, in 2008, and that wasn't during the start of the crash when prices were sky high, that was late on, prices already low as we got deeper into credit markets locking up.

# General bad backdrop, potential risks

Russia/Ukraine, Covid, are not going to make inflation and supply/demand problems go away. They're not going to lower taxes or energy/food costs. Russia is set to formally default on its debt around 4th May, 30 days after the payments were due (Star wars day! May the fourth be with you!). If Putin decides to test the 'escalate to de-escalate' (aka total insanity) theory, and starts throwing nukes around to show off, the market is not going to rally up on that.

We saw several major new strains of covid in the last two years. Alpha was 'tougher', Delta was 'tougher', and Omicron unlocked the 'spread to the planet in 2 months' feature. Consider original SARS in 2000 and the death rate it had, that's how bad this could get with a coronavirus -we know, because it already did!

If we get a strain of omicron with the lethality of SARS-2000, the market is gonna have a bad time. is it priced in? no. Meanwhile: plenty of countries looking at hyperinflation (south america, turkey, russia). Meanwhile: plenty of countries looking at stupidly priced housing markets due to collapse (Canada, Australia, NZ, UK, much of Europe, China, Taiwan...).

Remember Evergrande from last year, the Chinese property company with the biggest debts of any company on the planet? That hasn't gone away! People are just ignoring it as it slowly plays out. There's just a lot of really bad shit playing out in the background and not a lot of good shit to balance it out.

Though I'll admit: seeing Europe, USA, UK, Japan, Australia, etc coming together re: Russia/Ukraine? That's encouraging! That bodes well for the future, the more these important countries work together and try to do the right thing even when it's costly to do so. Democracy bros gotta be true bros, because there's a lot of bad bros out there. Oh and while it's in my mind, though I've been a bit dismayed at the state of the USA in the last decade, I have to say, you guys are certainly doing some great things lately in helping Ukraine defend itself. Nice one!

# The dollar is probably overvalued and if it weakens, inflation will go even higher in the USA.

There is an idea in the currency markets that real rates impact currency value. Assuming two countries were of similar attractiveness, you'd be better investing in the one giving the most return on your capital after taxes & inflation. Yet real rates in the USA are awful just now! The dollar is completely mispriced in my view. Having said that, short term it will probably continue to strengthen for the simple reason that 'in times of crisis, capital flees to perceived safety'. i.e. in the short term, in a crisis, 'return of capital' becomes more important than 'return on capital'. But long term? Ouch.

One of the problem of investing in US value stocks is that value stocks take typically years to play out, and in that timeframe you are maybe looking at a large loss on an overvalued currency. It might not even be possible to make money as a value investor outside the USA just now because of currency effects, unless you have a currency hedge. US investors may not care, but europoors should beware. This is already almost the worst time in 20 years for a european to be buying dollars. Check out the EURUSD rate on a 20 year chart. Yikes.

# Crypto

I was reading that young people nowadays prefer buying crypto to stocks or gold as a long term investment. e.g. [https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/03/investing/india-cryptocurrency-investing-future-hnk-intl/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/03/investing/india-cryptocurrency-investing-future-hnk-intl/index.html)

Let's be real. Somewhere between 98 and 100% of crypto coins are completely, hopelessly worthless. Probably 100%. It's like religion when you're an atheist: the reason I don't believe in *your* god, is probably the same as the reason you don't believe in 1000 other religion's gods. No special exceptions for your favourite crypto, sorry.

Considering e.g. Tether, I can't help but think the best epic-scale rugpull is still to come. People are only in crypto for the hope of rapid, massive gains yet they pretend it's 'about to be adopted as money'. It ain't happening guys. It's been 12 years now since Buttcorn came along and no one is using it as money.

Even *you* don't really use it as money. And if it ever did start acting like money, it won't produce 'gains'. If it produces 'gains', it can't be used as money. That's the thing about money; if it becomes an asset it stops being money. Even if crypto WAS money - and it's not, specifically because there's no tax system to physically enforce continual demand, and tax systems are what makes money-like into money - 'bad money drives out good', that's Gresham's law. The only thing keeping the crypto game going is the warm oxytocin glow of the bubbles, mania, euphoria in everything, the low rates.

Wait till you can't pay to keep the heating on in winter. Wait till you can't afford fuel for your car to get to work. Wait till the bank sends their final demand for payment. Then you'll find out who's a HODLer, who 'believes in the crypto dream'.

# Repent, ye bulls!

It's never to late to realise you have possibly fucked up and decide to become a bear or a kangaroo. Times change; models of investing that worked in the past may not work in the future and you won't be warned when the change is happening, when you are entering dangerous waters, when the tornado is about to arrive. Underwater caves are filled with the skeletons of skilled open-water divers. \[1\]

Remember, you don't need to always be in the market. It's OK to hold cash for a while, even with inflation devaluing it. Just ask any netflix shareholder.

Look at the 1970s, I think it might be a good model for what comes next. Sure, 8-10% inflation. But the stock market was a kangaroo market regardless, you could trade in and out of stocks/cash every few months that entire decade and still do far better than anyone who held only-cash or only-stocks the entire period.

\[1\] the film version of Ender's Game is awful, but there is one scene that is good, watch the scene where Ender meets Mazer Rackham. You are Ender, the market is Mazer Rackham.

Well I hope someone found this interesting. If it made you very annoyed, you should probably reflect on why that is, it probably says more about you and the risks you're taking, than it does about this post.

I wish all of you good luck because, to be blunt, we're all going to need it, me included. Thankfully there are still niches in the market where the tired investor can find peace and comfort, rare areas of well-priced shares with OK growth potential and decent economic prospects.

I'm not going to tell you where they are, because I spend hours every day looking for them, and lately, it's been like finding an oasis in the desert when I find some. But times change, hopefully in a few months, we will see the rains arrive and the desert bloom, and the bears and kangaroos and value investors can all dance together with joy in a beautiful paradise of good stocks at good prices. Talking of deserts...

# I met a traveller from an antique land,

# Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone

# Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,

# Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,

# And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,

# Tell that its sculptor well those passions read

# Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,

# The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;

# And on the pedestal, these words appear:

# My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;

# Look on my Netflix 500C gains, ye Mighty, and despair!

# Nothing beside remains. Round the decay

# Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare

# The lone and level sands stretch far away.”",SeaweedSignificant84,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ul3wo8/repost_bear_facts/,1652023044.0,63,35

* Revenue: $7.16 billion, vs $7.13 billion expected  (up 24% YOY) 

* Global paid net subscriber additions: 3.98 million vs 6.2 million expected

“We believe paid membership growth slowed due to the big Covid-19 pull forward in 2020 and a lighter content slate in the first half of this year, due to Covid-19 production delays,” Netflix said in its letter to shareholders.

When asked about their view on competition with the likes of Disney+, Netflix responded: “We don’t believe competitive intensity materially changed in the quarter or was a material factor in the variance as the over-forecast was across all of our regions,”

“As we’ve noted previously, the production delays from Covid-19 in 2020 will lead to a 2021 slate that is more heavily second half weighted with a large number of returning franchises,” 

Netflix also approved a buyback program to repurchase up to $5 billion in common stock, beginning in 2021 with no fixed expiration date. That’s expected to begin this quarter, the company said.

* Maybe Netflix's failure is a sign that streaming is a tough business and if Netflix can't do it well, how could Disney?

It feels like a lot of articles about Netflix being either a steady stock or a stock that will increase pretty well in the next few years, practically taking it from other companies, mostly cable as people are ""cutting the cord"". I feel like that was the right way to think about it a few years ago, but not now.

Practically any company that has things to watch is making a streaming service, and thats where netflix fails. They don't own any of FOX, Disney, and streaming services like Amazon Prime has practically an infinite windfall behind them to keep them ahead, as we saw with their recent MGM purchase.

And now that everyone has a streaming service, Netflix is losing a lot of their shows it feels. They've lost their most popular one to Peacock, and their own originals don't seem to be blowing up consistently like they did in the Stranger Things era when they had The Office along with many other shows.

So with all this, is it a time bomb? Would it be good to short it in the near or somewhat near future? Or even would it be good to buy now and then sell before the it crashes if it will?

174,sqvm4k,Anyone else think the dip on semiconductors will be a once in a decade opportunity to build wealth?,"Two major catalysts playing out for semis right now:

* Fed raising rates.
* Russia sanctions and possible invasion [cutting off key semiconductor materials](https://www.reuters.com/technology/white-house-tells-chip-industry-brace-russian-supply-disruptions-2022-02-11/).

In the next few months, these will play out and really pummel the semi stocks. But the good news is these are temporary events. After 1-2 years, we'll find a way around Russian chokehold on these key materials, and inflation will probably be slowed. While that's happening, covid is still subsiding and innovation continue it's relentless march of driving productivity forward.

To be clear, **I'm not saying to buy the dip right now.** But I'm tempted to start a ""eat ramen"", ""get a third job"", ""cancel Netflix"" regime for myself to start preparing as much as possible to start buying mid or later this year.

These semi stocks are becoming the new FANGS, and this upcoming dip this year might be the best chance to buy them before they rocket into FANG status.

OK here's the cons in my theory:

* China could still be a ticking time bomb. Most experts say their lockdown strategy is not viable for Omicron. Could be their supply chain is a lot more broken than we realize. Plus that real estate problem is still ongoing and their president is kinda insane.

* The Fed could freak out and raise rates too quickly, putting us into a recession.

* Some industry reports say oversupply of semiconductors could happen as early as 2023.

Amazon had \~151.9M US Customers in 2021. And its projected to have \~157.4M by end of 2022. The annual price increase: $119 > $139, will generate an additional $3.8B in revenue

(151.9M @ $119 = $18.07B  | 157.4M @ $139 = $21.87B)

But, only half (48%) of subscribers pay annually. 52% of Prime Subscribers in US who pay monthly (with relatively high loyalty - 97%), their rates are increasing from $12.99 to $14.99, resulting in the following numbers:

(78.98M @ $12.99 = $12.31B | 81.85M @ $14.99 = $14.72B)

An increase of $2.41B in revenue from monthly members.

(72.91M @ $119 = $8.67B | 75.55M @ $139 = $10.50B)

Which would result in an adjusted increase of $1.825B from annual subscribers.

Thus, Amazon will generate an additional $4.235B ($2.41B+$1.825B) in revenue as a result of this price increase.

The higher rates for monthly members, an increase of $24 per year, versus an increase $20 for annual members could see a migration of some monthly members to annual membership.

And, maybe that is what Amazon is trying to accomplish here. Remains to be seen if higher monthly costs will cause monthly subscribers to churn or convert to annual subscribers

**TLDR**: Same as title, the increase in Amazon Prime prices will result in an increase of \~$4.235B in annual revenue for Amazon from Prime memberships.

According to subscription analytics firm Antenna, Netflix cancellations surged 5x the normal amount following the release of “Cuties.”

Meanwhile, Data analytics firm YipitData reported a similar trend, with the company telling Yahoo Finance that Netflix’s U.S. churn “rose materially” last weekend in the wake of the controversy. As of last Saturday, disconnects were running at nearly 8x the daily levels observed in August — a multi-year high, YipitData added.

Still, despite the downbeat data, the cancellations should not have much of a lasting impact on Netflix’s overall subscriber base. The platform has well over 182 million users worldwide and is the clear leader in the competitive streaming space — regardless of its recent controversies.

Walt Disney said on Wednesday it had reached a deal with Sony Pictures to bring new ""Spider-Man"" movies and other films to Disney's streaming services and TV networks in the United States after they play on Netflix.

Disney also secured rights to offer older Sony films, including ""Jumanji"" and ""Hotel Transylvania,"" much sooner.

The company said it will add a significant number of Sony titles to Hulu starting in June.

This is a very positive news for Disney. It is spending more on contents to take on Netflix. As the economy reopening, Disney will be a better bet compared to Netflix due to it theme parks and studio businesses.

181,p6wbgf,Netflix and Viacom: The perfect buyout,"**It's not often that I’m in favor of consolidation or monopolistic behavior. But in this case I’m tired of paying 4 or 5 different streaming services. Someone has to start consolidating services and that somebody has to be Netflix.**

Netflix is stagnating. I think they see the writing on the wall. Their recent announcement to create a marketplace as well as games seemed to me a bit desperate. However, it’s not a bad if you own the right intellectual property to monetize this.

So let me break down why Netflix NEEDS Viacom to continue to survive.

**The Marketplace:**

So Netflix wants to start a marketplace. What are they going to sell in it? Can anyone name any kids show that they 100% own rights to and can sell kid toys n shit? I can’t and I have kids.

In comes Viacom. Think of all your kids’ favorite Nickelodeon shows that they own. And Comedy Central. And MTV for that matter, I can see them coming up with so much merchandise for these flagship shows.

**Gaming:**

I don’t know what Netflix’s plan is for gaming, but it sure would be easier if you had existing relationships with game publishers to license out your existing property. Thats what Viacom has done and licensed all of its nickelodeon characters for their new Nickelodeon Super Brawl World game as well as a few others they already have.

**Theme Parks:**

This is what would bring them at least on similar plane as Disney. The nickelodeon theme parks are not even in the same stratosphere as Disney, but they exist nonetheless and generate revenue. I don’t think Viacom owns the parks themselves but again they own a shit load of intellectual property that they currently lease out.

**Live TV:**

Netflix ain’t got it, they’ve been thinking about it, and Viacom got it. Not much else to be said.

**Sports:**

Viacom has the rights to the Super Bowl for 11 YEARS. Imagine watching the Super Bowl on Netflix, that would be cool.

Another hidden gem that not many know is Viacom owns **Bellator**, the only competitor to the UFC. There’s a lot of untapped potential there. They can become real competitors by streaming Bellator fights to their current subscribers.

Lastly, the holy grail of all - **Ads:**

This is Netflix’s kryptonite. The day the say they’re considering ads, I bet the stock craters. Or it goes up since its somewhat bullish move, but I bet new subscriber numbers go down. I know of one sneaky way in which they can start generating Ad revenue without pissing off existing subscribers - **Pluto TV**

Pluto TV was a hell of a purchase by Viacom. Its a free ad supported streaming service which is expected to hit 1 billion in revenue by the end of the year. They took it from 340m to 1 billion in a matter of 2 yrs.

Netflix can re-brand this free add supported service and start running shows to attract paid subscribers.

Bear case:

The only reason this wouldn’t happen is Netflix doesn’t have the cash to buy Viacom. Otherwise, they’re stupid not to.

TLDR;

Netflix should buy Viacom, that’s the only way they’ll continue to grow.",Tookie_Knows,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/p6wbgf/netflix_and_viacom_the_perfect_buyout/,1629308994.0,67,59

Netflix has struck a deal for the streaming rights to Sony films.

The deal, which was announced Thursday, includes films such as ""Morbius,"" ""Uncharted"" and ""Bullet Train.""

Netflix will also be able to place films such as ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" and future Venom and other Spider-Man films on its platform.

This deal could further strengthen Netflix streaming leader position. Netflix earning is coming and it is important to see what subscriber guidance company going to give due to the ongoing economy reopen. People start going out and consume less streaming, but on the other hand, Netflix is growing strong on the international market. It will be interesting to see if Netflix can beats subscriber # and defend the competition from Disney plus.

184,s9wwzr,"Devastated and depressed, any advice?","So my portfolio is down from 1.2m to 350k this year. I was devastated and have been depressed for quite some time now. I make a humble income and this portfolio is most of my networth, so this has been incredibly difficult for me. 

That being said, I would like some advice from here. Some may think I trade high-risk options with that kind of money. Actually not really, my holdings include Nio, Tesla, Eyes, Joby, Sofi, Aht, Btx, Mp, Cpe, Arkg, Arkk, Spce, Dkng, Fubo, Amc, Clov, Rlx, etc. I used 10-20% margin at some point that looked like buying opportunities which I shouldn’t have of course. 

Most of the time I just buy and hold (I didn’t even buy at the highest price). When stocks keep going down, I buy more. I don’t know how it happened but many of these stocks have gone down 70%+?? I don’t have any cash now and my portfolio is down 70%. I even sold some covered calls to hedge. 

What’s incredibly scary is that many experts keep saying a crash/recession coming soon. I don’t know what I’m supposed to think or do. Cutting losses now??? My stocks have crashed so hard already except Tesla, Mp, Cpe. I really don’t know what a crash means for those ultra growth stocks which have gone down 80% already?..and it’s been very difficult for me to cut losses at this deep (and I don’t know if there’s still a point in doing so)

Luckily I’m no longer on margin and I didn’t invest all my savings. So I’m not desperately in need of the 350k right now and can wait maybe 3-5 years. But what to do now? should I sell everything or keep my holdings or revise my portfolio? I can’t really afford to lose the money in the long run. And all this in the past year has been hurting my mental health. Anyone has any advice?

EDIT: thanks guys for all the advice. I feel better and calmer now about the situation. I know I was gambling and was not looking for sympathy. Thank you for everyone who’s concerned. 

The reason I picked those stocks was that I followed some popular financial analysts bloggers and joined their discords. They recommended some of these stocks and think my holdings are relatively safe and suggested me to hold whenever I was attempted to sell (they say some of these are to be held for 3-5 years like Sofi, Joby, Nio). I followed their advice because I reached 1.2m from low six figures in 2020 using margin buying SPACs and penny stocks I found online (risky behavior paid off…) I sold most of them and got into the stocks I mentioned above. I also had INTC, QQQ, Netflix, AMD, NVDA, CCL, JWN, Microsoft, etc, however, I sold them at some point to average down the “bad stocks.” Apparently, I didn’t anticipate things could go this wrong. 

Anyway, that’s my story and lesson. Don’t fully trust those “experts” who’re so sure about some small-cap opportunity…

Edit 2: lots of folks are saying about I should have sold stocks and changed my portfolio at 1.2m. I was considering it but the taxes I would have to pay for selling those winners deterred me (like half of my gains come on, but if I wait it out till a year, it would save me a lot)…and then March hit and then May hit and then things went to hell…

Edit 3: Since many asked, I started small in 2018 and only deposit a lot more into my account around august 2020 I think? The portfolio was worth 250k then. Yea what a crazy year…THANK YOU again for all the great suggestions.

Edit 4: peeps keep saying why I didn’t realize the stocks I were holding were high risks. I DID. I only said I didn’t buy “high-risk options” (I didn’t buy any options at all). And I thought only AMC and clove are meme/wsb stocks?? Correct me if I’m wrong. I was hoping for a quick gain and then failed to cut losses.",unsubscribe_life,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/s9wwzr/devastated_and_depressed_any_advice/,1642836010.0,1033,924

Carvana's financial troubles spilled over into debt markets this week when the online used-car dealer struggled to sell bonds and was forced to turn to Apollo Global Management Inc. for $1.6 billion to salvage the deal. The giant investment firm agreed to purchase about half of $3.275 billion of bonds Carvana is issuing to purchase car-auction network ADESA U.S., people familiar with the matter said. Carvana had a hard time attracting investors following a disappointing first-quarter earnings report and stock selloff. Apollo’s intervention highlights the growing clout of private debt and equity firms that are bankrolling swaths of the U.S. economy. Shares of Carvana surged during the pandemic but tumbled over the past eight months as secondhand car prices declined and investors grew concerned about the company’s continued losses. ADESA was meant to accelerate growth, and Carvana hired JPMorgan Chase to raise billions of dollars in debt and equity to pay for the purchase and subsequent integration.

The financing ran into headwinds last week when the company reported a more-than sixfold increase in net losses for the first quarter of 2022 compared with a year earlier. The company was one of the biggest losers in the tech stock selloff, which was driven by rising interest rates and worries about a recession. Carvana blamed a mix of tough economic conditions—rising interest rates, higher gas prices, inflation-weary consumers—for its first-ever decline in quarterly retail sales. It also acknowledged to investors that the constant pressure to continue its rapid expansion has played an outsize role in its priorities, and it pledged to reduce costs and improve its efficiency. The deal with Apollo is an acknowledgment that filling the hole in its balance sheet had taken precedence over growth. The onerous interest rate on the debt could make it difficult for the company to invest in growth. Carvana has burned cash since its founding 10 years ago.

Carvana shares dropped about 30% in recent weeks and bond prices also fell, pushing up the yield that bond investors demanded to lend the company more money. Bond yields rise when prices fall. Carvana disclosed plans Monday to issue $2.275 billion of bonds and $1 billion of preferred shares for the ADESA acquisition. Chief Executive Ernie Garcia III and his father, Ernie Garcia II, participated in a roughly $1.2 billion new common-stock issue to boost cash levels. Apollo privately committed to buy $600 million of the preferred shares, but JPMorgan struggled to find enough buyers for the bonds, fund managers who considered the deal said. By Tuesday, the clearing yield for the bond deal was above 10.5%, a level that might have forced JPMorgan to forgo some or all of its fees for the financing, the fund managers said. Apollo, which has invested in Carvana stock and debt for years, proposed an alternative: Carvana would scrap the preferred stock sale and issue $3.3 billion of 10.25% bonds backstopped by a $1.6 billion order from Apollo. That yield is well above the average for most junk bonds.

The revised deal came with a twist, in which Carvana would be barred from prepaying the new debt for about five years—roughly twice the normal period for junk bonds. Apollo stands to make about 1.6 times its money if the bonds are subsequently repaid. It would have made about 1.3 times its money on the preferred shares, one of the people familiar with the matter said. Such large checks have grown increasingly common as private fund managers raised unprecedented sums of money, prompting them to hunt for increasingly big trade ideas. The funds provided jumbo rescue loans to companies like Airbnb Inc. and Carnival Corp. during the depths of the coronavirus pandemic.

Apollo manages about half a trillion dollars and made a similar $1.5 billion preferred-stock investment in Hertz Global Holdings Inc. in 2021 to help lift the car-rental company out of bankruptcy. The Hertz deal paid out handsomely, but Carvana’s future is uncertain for now. Moody’s Investors Service cut its credit rating of Carvana this week to triple-C, one of the lowest rungs on the junk-debt ratings ladder, citing persistent lack of profitability, negative cash flow and corporate-governance risk. Credit ratings firm S&P Global said Wednesday that the replacement of the preferred equity with debt will result in higher interest costs that will put pressure on the company’s cash flow. S&P estimated that the additional capital would help the company cover about two years of cash burn. “Technology companies can offer excess yield, but investors need to pay attention to the quality and stability of cash flows,” said Scott Giardina, managing director at FS Investments. “Technology business models are generally asset light, and bankruptcy recoveries will tend to be lower than more traditional asset-based companies.” Carvana, which went public in 2017, has burned through cash and relied heavily on debt investors to fund its operations, similar to tech companies such as Netflix Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc.",WickedSensitiveCrew,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ueyqcc/carvana_once_a_stock_market_darling_forced_to/,1651275973.0,10,40

So if the revenues, net income are nearly identical between the two companies and paramount + is now outpacing netflix in subscribers, is it fair to say this is a very undervalued stock?  Netflix is essentially valued at 6.5X right now.  A morning star report all noted that Paramount + was one of the fastest growing brands in 2021.  I've seen commercials on tv for Paramount + too advertising Halo which ive heard has a been a huge hit.",tempestlight,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ttd4qc/para_undervalued_paramount/,1648770652.0,15,18
194,u8dfmh,Should some of the formerly high flying tech stocks initiate a dividend?,"Facebook, Netflix, and PayPal come to mind as tech stocks that have had major crashes recently.  

All 3 companies make a healthy profit, but crashed after growth slowed. 

I have some interest in all 3, but I think they ought to initiate a dividend to reward shareholders who may have a long wait before sentiment shifts",Jumbo86,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u8dfmh/should_some_of_the_formerly_high_flying_tech/,1650509324.0,18,19

* Netflix is trying to hire an executive to oversee an expansion into video games, The Information reports.
* And it's approached industry veterans in the past few weeks in the effort, according to the report.
* The  streaming giant had barely dipped a toe into games before, including  using an outside developer to build a game based on its hit *Stranger Things,* the ambitions may be bigger now.
* And one option includes offering a bundle of games similar to Apple's Arcade subscription offering, according to the report.",Ironleg01,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nhtr0l/netflix_seeking_executive_to_lead_videogame/,1621607041.0,95,158

197,u4xg2a,SP500 Price-To-Sales Ratio,"By now most of us have been brought to the attention of the rising P/S of SP500, it seems the current equal-weight P/S ratio has nearly doubled over the last 10 years. I did some research on the top100 companies (by weight -- I had to search each ticker and record the numbers manually, that's why I couldn't do all 500) and did the following:

&#x200B;

1. Record 3Y, 5Y, 10Y, 15Y and 20Y P/S
2. Measure against current P/S as %
3. Sort by lowest % on 3Y, 5Y and 10Y
4. Filter out anything over 85%

&#x200B;

||vs 3Y|vs 5Y|vs 10Y|vs 15Y|vs 20Y|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Paypal|50%|54%||||
|Facebook|62%|57%|53%|||
|Netflix|63%|63%|69%|77%|83%|
|Starbucks|71%|74%|75%|80%|85%|
|Adobe|76%|80%|88%|96%|104%|
|Salesforce|76%|79%|81%|82%||
|Disney|78%|82%|87%|94%|103%|
|3M|78%|74%|76%|80%|82%|
|Citigroup|81%|77%|78%|81%|76%|
|Pfizer|81%|81%|85%|89%|91%|
|Intel|82%|81%|83%|82%|81%|
|IBM|84%|80%|76%|75%|75%|

My rationale is, anything under 100% vs 3Y, 5Y and 10Y means they have not ""doubled over the last 10 years"", hence off the Burry radar, which may mean they are better value among their peers?

Then I use Morningstar's Fair Value, while it may not be the best calculation, I reckon with the same methodology applied to these companies, it should still give some meaningful comparison. I keep companies with at least 70% of Morningstar's FV:

&#x200B;

||Fair Value|Current|Current$ of FV|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Paypal|$145|$102|70%|
|Facebook|$400|$210|53%|
|Adobe|$615|$420|68%|
|Salesforce|$320|$196|59%|
|Citigroup|$78|$51|65%|
|Intel|$65|$46|70%|

Worth mentioning that P/S of C is 1.24 (max 1.64) and INTC is 2.43 (max 3.00). So of the six above, perhaps Citigroup and Intel are now reasonably priced to enter?",investulator,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u4xg2a/sp500_pricetosales_ratio/,1650114462.0,20,20

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

199,set0lg,Is Big Tech Really Overvalued?,"The narrative here lately is that valuations are crazy even amongst the big tech and this is a major bubble we are in and we should expect a correction up to the 50% etc.

Well, if we simply look from an earnings estimates perspective and compare this to these companies' past, it doesn't look overvalued mostly.

These earnings growth estimates are just estimates that's for sure, but not unachievable.

I've used the estimates from Finviz and compared them to their past PE data gathered from Macrotrends.

**Google**

Currently sitting at 25 PE, which is expected to drop more after the earnings announcement. When I look at the average for Google in the last 14 years, this number seems to be the average and even closer to the bottom in the last 5 years. Google's earnings have grown 21% on average in the last 5 years, and are expected to continue growing at the same pace for the next 5 years.

**Facebook**

I know the hate amongst Facebook well enough, but wherever you look from it, this stock is cheap.  Currently sitting at 21 PE which is the cheapest ever Facebook's stock ever been other than the 2008 crisis. The company has grown on an annual 50% growth rate for the last 5 years and is expected to continue its growth at 22% for the next five years. Also, I see a huge potential for Oculus brand. It's currently the best VR in the market by far and I do believe it is the finally the VR people have been expecting for years; it doesn't require a computer to run nor any cables.

**Amazon**

Amazon also sitting at its lowest PE ever (54) for the last 20 or more years, and grown at 101% annual growth rate in the last 5 years. But for the next 5 years, Amazon is expected to grow at a 36% growth rate. It still looks a bit expensive purely looking at these numbers but we all know Amazon is investing into so many different areas and can catch unexpected opportunities for faster growth.

**AMD**

This one is my favorite. AMD's earnings have grown 35% on average in the last 5 years, and are expected to keep growing at 39% for the next 5 years. And compared to this, its PE is only 31. This is also the lowest AMD's PE has ever been.

**NVIDIA**

Nvidia has similar earnings growth rates compared to AMD (past 5 years 45%, next 5 years expected 39%). However, its PE ratio is sitting at 68, which is almost the most expensive NVDA has ever been.

**APPLE**

Apple is at 29 PE, which is historically quite high for Apple and is expected to grow only at 15% for the next 5 years (last 5 years was 22%). I don't think Apple is cheap, however, I do think investors like the balance sheet of Apple too much. No one know what might Apple lead into next, home electronics, EV, healthcare or smart home, which makes Apple's stock pricier. Also as a famous value investor, Warren Buffett is still all-in on Apple.

**MICROSOFT**

People usually compare Microsoft PE with its past average, which was about 12 PE for almost 10 years, and it's currently sitting at 34 PE. But what people forget is in that 8-10 year period, Microsoft's EPS **almost had zero growth**. Only in the last 5 years Microsoft started to grow and at a great pace of 26% annually. However, analysts expect this to fall into 17% annually for the next 5 years, so Microsoft's stock still looks pricey compared to its peers. I don't think it is cheap but I think this price comes from the mistrust against these expected growth numbers because of Microsoft's potential.

&#x200B;

So what do you think? Do you expect Google's PE to fall to 12? Or AMD into 15 while expecting this pace of growth?",ace66,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/set0lg/is_big_tech_really_overvalued/,1643382844.0,130,69
