We are continuously signed up, but only watch it every couple months (Witcher a few months ago, Ozark right now, probably Stranger things in a few months). My mom's house has our account on her TV because my kids visit often enough that they use it there, and I think there's a possibility it's at my wife's parents house as well.

Literally the only reason we don't cancel is because it's ingrained in our system already and we don't want to take it away from the possible use at the parents house. If they start charging extra for it, or stop us from doing it? It's just canceled, that's all. We'll put Disney+ or Hulu or Sling up when they visit again. It seriously feels like a gym membership for one you barely attend threatening more fees at this point.

(edit:  as one Redditor pointed out, I forgot to mention *Is It Cake?* as a show that was worth the sub)

(edit2:  a few clarifications for things that have come up a few times: 

 I didn't mean *literally* like a gym membership, but as in a fee you keep paying even though you're not really using it, so there is no need to explain how I can't physically sneak people into a gym.

I absolutely agree it would be smarter to just quit everything and only subscribe to one service a month, cancel it, swap, etc. But there's no way most of us are doing that on multiple devices each month.

> Netflix won&#039;t carry the 20 Russian free-to-air propaganda channels that they could be required to host under Russian law.

> In December 2021, Netflix was added by the Russian regulator, Roskomnadzor, to its register for audiovisual services because the SVOD reached over 100,000 subscribers.

> Netflix is theoretically required as part of a law - known locally as the Vitrina TV law - to distribute 20 &quot;Must-carry&quot; free-to-air Russian news, sports and entertainment TV channels.

If I was Netflix and the country in question had a healthy and competitive ISP market I would argue they should just allow ISPs to slow down Netflix traffic, but they have to list what speed they are slowing Netflix down by. If the consumers have a choice, they will choose to go with ISPs that doesn't make their movies buffer like crazy. Or ISPs can offer a more expensive non filtered package.

> According to Reuters, the ISP is suing Netflix to pay up for using so much bandwidth and the maintenance costs due to traffic surges stemming from the streaming giant.

> In the blog, Netflix says it&#039;s been a &quot;Platform for the spread of new Hallyu culture through shows like Kingdom, Vincenzo, and even the recently premiered Squid Game.&quot; It also touted that Squid Game is the first Korean series to make it to the No. 1 spot on Netflix US.As for where all this is coming from? Earlier in June, a South Korean court sided against Netflix in a case where the streaming company argued that SK Broadband had no grounds to demand bandwidth fees.

> Back in 2014, Netflix and Comcast were at odds over the ISP throttling Netflix.

If Netflix is requested dedicated line from the ISP, and is increasing the bandwidth requirements on it drastically, then they should be paying for it. 

If the ISP setup a dedicated line to ease congestion in their own network that's on them, and their end users. 

I have no idea how Netflix's CDN is setup, but I'd have to imagine they'd have a CDN server in S. Korea with the Korean language content and the most popular shows mirrored to it. Having multiple ISP's providing service to a CDN, data center, or even large company is the first rule of networking.

Input delay combined with streaming video delay is a significant detriment to the gaming experience for most games, and it's a very hard problem to solve.

Lunas cellular input approach was the most innovative and imo best solution to date, but even steam links or moonlight local game streaming has enough delay to ruin the experience for most games.  Additionally, these services all take the same approach of having only a couple major data centers, which fucks over most people outside of say, Cali and the Virginia areas (this is guarantied to make this type of service fail every time).

447,i5kpw74,t3_u7xqd8,t3_u7xqd8,"Netflix made six major mistakes I can think of:

1.)They didn't lock down established IP when they had a chance.  They rented, rather than bought.  Now, maybe not every IP holder would have sold in perpetuity, but enough probably would have ... especially if it wasn't exclusive, to make a big difference.  Bit by bit Netflix basically lost the entirety of their worthwhile movie library and most of their television library (AMC excluded).  

2.)They tried to pivot into their own in-house movie and TV production, and unlike a company like HBOMax or Disney, they don't have an established creative hierarchy that knows what the fuck they're doing.  They basically paid hundreds of millions of dollars for unending garbage.  What's even worse, they continuously canceled shows they had created before their runs had ended ... which creates a cycle of pissed off customers unwilling to invest their time in the next show for fear it will also be axed early. 

3.)They raised prices and cracked down on usability while the service got worse.  Bad combination.

4.)When they began to lose content, they didn't actually pivot into a space where their funding and bandwidth could have allowed them a new way to dominate: news and sports.  Their steadfast decision to remain a rental and production house when their rental wing essentially died (as companies pulled back their IP) has been disastrous.

5.)They decided to become political activists.  Whether you agree or disagree with the socio-political positions they have taken as a company, the reality is that when a corporation takes a stand they're going to make someone mad.  

6.)They didn't return shareholder value in the form of dividends or stock buybacks.  I took a hard look at Netflix back in February or March of this year, thinking I might be buying a dip, but I concluded the stock was still massively overvalued.

Subscription revenue from subscribers and price has steadily risen with two distinct increase spikes in mid 2017 and Q1 2022 at their new rate.

Subsections have not historically dropped off due to price increases.

There have been several quarters in the past that were a near zero rise too.  Q1 20222 just happened to to the first instance below zero.  Q4 2021 was also a higher than average increase, and the negative is likely just dumb luck in timing with more jumping on late Q4 rather than early Q1.

The high volume of media seems...targeted.  There's a huge negative narrative around really mild and entirely inline numbers.

Netflix is still the biggest streaming service by a significant margi margin.  Hulu is much lower and growing slower.  Disney+ is lower but the only one growing faster...because Disney.  HBO and HBO Plus is much lower and nearly flat and stagnant for growth.  Amazon Prime is the only thing that matches Netflix, but Prime also covers many other things besides streaming.

People might complain about spending, but that's also the side of the equation they have full control over.  So the numbers here are deliberate.  The one thing they can't control is subscriptions, and that's STILL inline with the long term trend. AND they're making the most revenue they ever had, today.

But it's dinner' somehow all bad, scary scary, and the stock tanked for...reasons???

Its totally instantaneous. If it happened during market hours then the same thing would happen. A computer would offer 50,000 shares 12% below the bid and clean out the book and the stock would move accordingly as the model says the stock is worth 12% less. The fact that it still bounces around some is due to different investors have different models and positions. 

While to us smaller traders/investors it seems like the reaction is sever and instant there is actually a lot of evidence that it takes a few days/weeks for this new information to play out and settle at its true new value.

I don't think you understand how Bond Prices work. They're inversely related to interest rates - so with the expectation interest rates are going to increase, their prices fall. Obviously. This means that Coupon Rates have to increase - or you can buy Bonds when you think Interest Rate Increases are priced in. Then, wait for the next round of Interest Rate Decreases and sell them for a profit. So, yeah... Bonds are fairly attractive right now....

>Netflix and Facebook are still growth companies, their earnings quality is only improving, and they have IMMENSE pricing power that they've only begun to tap into

Yes, Netflix, a company that lost 200,000 Subscribers - the first time it's lost subscribers in 10 Years - is obviously a growth company. Facebook faces incredibly political headwinds and it's growth is slowing. You can be optimistic about its push into the Metaverse - but their core business model is stalling. You'd have to look at their other operations. But, again, biggest factor is regulation for Facebook.

>So-called 'investors' firmly believe that staples are the place to be right now, because 'interest rates' and 'inflation'.

Uh... Yeah... Interest rates signal contractionary macroeconomic policy - literally reducing aggregate demand and curtailing investment spending. It is a signal that the macroeconomy is overheating and a general pullback is needed. This means Consumer Staples are considered a relative safe place to put money - because they are generally Recession Proof.

>Inflation is good for corporate profitsInflation requires higher interest rates

Inflation is temporarily good for corporate profits - but it also depends on what kind of inflation. Demand Pull inflation is good, Cost Push inflation is bad. The overwhelming majority of inflation is Cost Push which is terrible for margins. Corporate Profits are a lagging indicator and what you really need to look at going forward are Profit Margins. You should be expecting them to shrink as Input Costs continue to increase.

Higher interest rates ARE A LITERAL CATASTROPHE FOR BONDS

I already commented on this - they're terrible if you already owned Bonds which is why people are selling them. They're attractive once the market incorporates Interest Rate Expectations. Once you feel the Bond Market has priced in expected Interest Rate Hikes they would be a great buy since you'll get a high Coupon Rate and also can sell them in the future during the next Easing Cycle

The answer is to own quality assets, which are companies with strong cash flows, moats, network effects, etc.

Which.... would be Consumer Staples....

>People calling this tech bubble 2.0 are either too young to understand what the tech bubble was, or too stupid to understand what it was.

Growth Companies rely on Consumer Discretionary and Easy Liquidity to finance expansion and growth - both of which are drying up fast. I'm not going to go into every company you mentioned, but when inflation is high, there is contractionary monetary policy, and real wages are shrinking, there is no reason to expect Consumer Discretionary will do well. If your real wages are shrinking and you need to spend more money on Consumer Staples (Groceries, Toiletries, Gasoline) you have less money to spend on things you'd normally get from Amazon. You're more likely to cancel your Netflix Account and spend that extra $15 on gas or something else.

TL;DR - Not going to respond to every point, but you're missing the mark completely.

So some companies’ share prices are lower or flat, but valuation or premium you pay for a share is higher. Some companies’ prices are higher, but the company actually outperformed and the valuation has become more attractive even with a higher share price.

That would take an utter catastrophe that quite frankly...look...even as a bear myself, you just can't predict that kind of catastrophe, so there's no point in even considering it or trying to plan for it, because you'll be paralyzed by fear *always*, because there's *always* the possibility that everything will blow up in your face.

A reasonable expectation would be another 10-25% down from here in the broad market, varying by the type of company or industry.  You can't point to anything fundamental or statistical to justify a fear of anything greater than that.  To be sure--it could still happen, absolutely.  But you cannot be *reasonably* fearful of that, in my opinion.

As an aside: Netflix is a different story.  Anyone with half a lick of sense could reasonably say that its continued expansion was implausible, due to a huge number of competitors in the media space, and that a PE of 60 was way too much. That was a perfectly reasonable position to take, and look, it panned out.  But Netflix hasn't crashed due to the market going tits-up--it's crashed because a lot of folks came to their senses and started valuing it as what it is: a media company.  And lo and behold, its PE is now in line with other media companies, and there *will* be a valuation floor for it as long as it continues to make money.",HeyYoChill,1652027677.0,38

Netflix is in a tough position with so much competition.   Which also then increases the cost of acquiring content.

QCOM (who grew revenue by 30%) sees automotive as moving from a 1B market to a 10B market by the end of the decade.  They are also trading at a forward PE less than 15 with strong FCF.

But NFLX has done a good job of defending content, and thus market, share through the most competitive period in streaming history to date.

833,htq0jn6,t3_s9wwzr,t3_s9wwzr,"I might be blunt, but this portfolio is made entirely from meme stocks. These are usually unprofitable companies, which reached sky-high valuations on pure speculation in 2020/21. Most likely their stock prices will correct to some reasonable levels sometimes in the future either by the companies increasing their revenue or the stock price falling. Some of them already corrected. First you should read Burton J. Malakiel's A random walk through Wall street and Peter (not David) Lynch's One up Wall street! Both devote entire chapters to these irrational bubbles and how stocks behave under these circumstances.  The catch is that during the investing mania phase these stocks perform incredibly well, as investors build air castles and buy them like crazy. However when the mania dies off, their shares tumble without any kind on support, since they were not that good companies to begin with. They bring the most profit, when you buy them relatively cheap and then sell them when the price starts to deteriorate.

Your stocks reflect this exact problem. Most of these companies generate losses. Nio, Eyes, Joby, Sofi, Aht, Btx, Cpe, Spce, Dkng, Fubo, Amc, Clov, are all generating losses. These stock's valuations are simply based on hopes that in the foreseeable future they will grow/improve to the point that they will make some profits.

In the old days, investors like Malakiel and Lynch advised, that a PE of over 15 is an extremely risky bet on any stock. This rule most likely faded, you can only buy tobacco companies that cheap nowadays. Still, the PE of Tesla being \~300, MP being 59, these are extremely high even in today's markets. The average PE sits around 40 now. The only reasonably priced paper in this portfolio is Rlx, with a PE of 25. Arkg and Arkk invest their money into the same category of stocks, they will follow the performance of your other stocks closely.

You have several paths you can take from here, the choice most likely depending on your predictions on market behavior. None of us can tell you what will happen in the future, you have to rely on your own assessment of the situation.

1. If you think that this is a transitory phenomenon and these stocks will increase to their previous levels, hold them and simply wait until your portfolio increases in value.
2. If you think that this is the market crash that people have been expecting for a time, then sell everything and put the money into treasury bonds.
3. If you think this is just a routing of the more speculative excess, you can sell everything and put your money into sp500 index funds hoping that the contagion will not reach the larger companies.
4. If you think this contagion only affects tech stocks,  you can sell everything and put the money into value index funds. That way you can avoid the tech collapse.
5. If you think this is a unique phenomenon on the US stock market, you can put your money into an ETF containing foreign stocks. You can even choose, which contry or region to invest your money.

None of us have a crystal ball, we do not know for certain what will happen. We can only make educated guesses about the stock market.  That is the inherent risk in investing.",Durumbuzafeju,1642841962.0,660

880,i5kyu8k,t3_u8dfmh,t3_u8dfmh,"Yes. The idea that you should only buy a stock because it will always appreciate is being called into question on this stock market dip.  Companies that make a ton of cash should pay their stock holders a decent dividend.  Than as a stock holder you can ask yourself the question.  Should I reinvest those dividends into more shares, which I almost always do, or take the cash.  

I think you have discovered the major reason tech stocks are underperforming.  Let the stock holders choose if they are bullish on these stocks with their dollars.  Tech stocks that are profitable should absolutely raise their dividends.  It would be a bullish indicator.",drew-gen-x,1650518644.0,2

Disney has games, merch, theme parks oriented around its characters. Netflix has built all these universes, but they only go as far as a few seasons of streaming.

This is probably about making games based on Netflix shows and distributing through existing channels, rather than introducing a whole new gaming product for subscribers. That's the fastest and safest next step. They can also use their app to promote them, e.g. you might get a marketing notification from iOS Netflix app that links you to a game about a show you watched.",calmdime,1621621742.0,5

896,i4ylr19,t3_u4xg2a,t3_u4xg2a,"I agree C and INTC are cheap. But I’m not willing to invest heavily into either of those businesses YET. In my humble opinion, they’re both turnarounds. They both messed up badly under their previous CEO’s, and brought in new CEO’s to turn things around. And like Peter Lynch said, I’d like to see real evidence of them turning around before I really invest in them.

I look at C like the 4th best pizzeria in a town with 4 pizzerias. Even if they’re selling their business to me at a cheap price, I don’t think I want to buy the worst one in town. I would rather wait until they become maybe the 2nd best in town, even if it means I would have to pay more at the point. 

I look at INTC like the big old store in town that keeps losing customers to the newer stores that opened up in town. Sure, it’s still bigger, making more money, and I can buy it cheap. But I don’t know if I wanna buy a store that keeps losing its customers. I would rather wait and if I see them gaining their lost customers back, I’ll buy that store, even if it means I have to pay more at that point.

I know many people would disagree with me and that’s fine. We all have different styles of investing. This is just what I’m personally more comfortable with.
